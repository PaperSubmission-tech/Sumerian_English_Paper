Holy An, the great words of his mouth are not to be abrogated. The great gods bow down to him, like a curved staff, in approval of and in prayer to him.  What you command is just. (Like) what a prince or lord has uttered, what you have commanded is obeyed. An, your lofty command takes precedence, who would say No to you? Father of the gods, your word, the foundation of heaven and earth, no god fails to heed it.  Lord, you are the leader who takes only his own counsel, what should be our counsel? Grant your strength to the maiden Ištar, whom you have loved.   Your reliable approval, weighty as heaven, make known (to her) in our assembly.  Give to the mistress, whom you have loved, your combined divine powers.   Let Kišar truly be the spouse equal with you, may she rise to the (equivalent) authority of your name.  Moreover, in addition let her carry out herself the decrees of Enlil and Enki.    When she alone has taken hold of the nose-rope of heaven and earth, she shall be our strength! For An, the pleasant conversation produced happiness.He in his goodness of heart treated holy Inanna well.   The commands of my Anu-ship are the complex fundament(?) of heaven which cannot be equaled.  My fixed boundaries whose exteriors are fearsome and know no approaching, I am Anšar/Anu, the king's helper, do take hold of their band.   Do take for yourself the entire extent of their territory, exercise alone the ruling of them!Come, rise up to my dais of kingship and dwell in the heights!Corresponding to my called name, may Exalted Kišar/Antu be your called name! My faithful vizier, whose lips are prized, who is aware of my secrets, Ninšubur, my fitting vizier, shall exercise the status of father with you. May he (standing) before you constantly present auspicious words from (every) god and goddess. At the eternal foundation of heaven and earth and by the enduring designs of the gods,  when, in the beginning, Anu, Enlil and Ea allotted the shares, for the two gods, the watchmen of heaven and netherworld, the ones who open the door of Anu,for moon-god and sun-god the night and day were made in equal parts, and from the bottom of heaven to the top of heaven they assign them their tasks: to keep all the stars of heaven on course as in a furrow, to make the leading gods keep to their paths like oxen. Up into that place, Inanna, rise to the rulership of them all! Lady, you be the brightest of them, so may they call you Ištar of the Stars!  May your high position (relative to them) alternate between the two sides (east and west) triumphantly!May your splendor be as abundant as that of the moon and sun in (their) watches. May the flaring glow of your torch shine high in the sky!  May the people marvel at you as one for whom among the gods there is none to check up on her.After the lord had bestowed (these) great powers upon the daughter of Sîn, he did not keep her away from the shrine Eanna, her sacred chamber.After king Anu had bestowed the great powers upon her, they presented to her the shrine Eanna, her sacred chamber. He covered her figure with the ceremonial garment of Anu-hood, the brilliant splendor of Sîn.He made her appear like the day with superb ornaments, the ornaments of divinity. He enhanced her arm with the scepter of kingship, the fierce wood (staff), the unsparing weapon.   A glorious crown which is like (that on) the head of Nanna he set (firmly) upon her head.  O Hierodule, my important decisions, divine powers which could not be asked for (by anyone else) I have assigned to you. Like me, may Enlil, king of all the lands, treat you well!  Because of this Lord Nunamnira became happy, his liver surged with joy.3rd tablet of Exalted Lady Who Alone is Mighty, not finished.Tablet of {m}21-35-35-26-44, son of {m}21-11-20-42. Holy An, the great words of his mouth are not to be abrogated. The great gods bown down to him, like a curved staff, in approval of and in prayer to him.  What you command is just. (Like) what a prince or lord has uttered, what you have commanded is obeyed. An, your lofty command takes precedence, who would say No to you? Father of the gods, your word, the foundation of heaven and earth, no god fails to heed it.  Lord, you are the leader who takes only his own counsel, what should be our counsel? Grant your strength to the maiden Ištar, whom you have loved.   Your reliable approval, weighty as heaven, make known (to her) in our assembly.  Give to the mistress, whom you have loved, your combined divine powers.   Let Kišar/Antu truly be the spouse equal with you, may she rise to the (equivalent) authority of your name.  Moreover, in addition let her carry out herself the decrees of Enlil and Enki.    When she alone has taken hold of the nose-rope of heaven and earth, she shall be our strength! For An, the pleasant conversation produced happiness.He in his goodness of heart treated holy Inanna well.   The commands of my Anu-ship are the complex fundament(?) of heaven which cannot be equaled.  My fixed boundaries whose exteriors are fearsome and know no approaching, I am Anšar/Anu, the king's helper, do take hold of their band.   Take for yourself the entire extent of their territory, exercise alone the rule of them!Come, rise up to my dais of kingship and dwell in the heights!Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, Copy of stele of diorite, property of Ezida: Nabû-balāssu-iqbi, son of Miṣir-āya, wrote (it).Basket-of-tablets: long tablets of Lu-Ningirsu, son of Bazi, are here; year: “Enunugal of Inanna.” May the arrowhead that pierces lungs and heart go back and forth like a shuttle. Inanna, after you have made fighting and battle flip about(?) like a skip-rope, O lady of battle, make them clash together like a ball(?) and driving stick. Goddess of contention, make battle be pursued like puppets=dolls being manipulated. Lady, at the place of clashing of weapons, strike with chaos like the banging down of astragals. Inanna, when like an overwhelming storm you are consolidating the contingents of battle, when you demonstrate your great ability with the divine mace, the double-headed ax, the big sword and arrows,  when you put on the fierce armor, let the deluge rage. When you make ready your bow/throw-stick(?) and shield of battle, may the storms whirl about for you. May your raging divine weapon strike the evil person with lightning like (the plague god) Erra. Lady, at the place of clashing of weapons and planting of standards, no one can get away from the opening of your arms. My daughter, wherever it is pleasing to you to extend upwards, to extend downwards, to pull taut or to loosen, Having no limits at the place where destinies are decided, your pronouncements are indeed as great as my pronouncements. At festivals, offerings, banquets, prostration(?), making obeisance, and invoking the name (of the god), a human being whose god has gotten very angry with him, whose goddess has become soured/jealous towards him, as long as he does not seek out the place of reconciliation with your divinity, no god will be agreeable to his petition. At my city, the mountain of Sumer and Akkad, the shade of the world quarters, at Duranki, the bond of heaven and earth, the foundation of all constructed settlements,  at my royal dais reposing like a horned bull (or elephant?) at the obeisances of the gods, at my sanctuary Nippur, the shrine of Enlil-ship, the mainstay/great wall of the nation, the sanctuary, the relaxing dwelling place which is called by my name, may your ladyship also be manifested in that place, may your name be called Queen of Nippur! The good protective spirit, (my) eloquent god who is standing in front of me, the craftsman of the centerpoint of the Ekur temple, discoverer of advice and planning, the finest oil, let be your guardian be he against whom your wrath was great and whom your divine fury has overcome. May wise Nin-imma'imma cool your heart with pleasant conversations. Lady, I have established for you my weighty commands, divine powers that should not be demanded by anyone; as I (have done), may Ea, king of the Apsu, treat you well. Because of this, the prince Nudimmud became happy, his liver rose with joy.Long tablet of Iqīša, heir of Ištar-šūma-ēreš, descendent of Ekur-zakir the incantation priest. Hand of Ištar-šūma-ēreš his son. One who reveres Anu, Enlil, and Ea will not take it away, (or) who borrows it must not intentionally allow it to become lost.

It was time to decide destinies in heaven and on earth, Lagash had raised the head towards heaven in large ‘me’, Enlil looked righteously upon lord Ningirsu. Did the ‘nig2-ul’ not emerge in our city? The ‘heart’, did it not return to its banks? The ‘heart’ of Enlil, did it not return to its banks? The ‘heart’, did it not return to its banks? The flood, did it not twinkle? Frightening (all). The ‘heart’ of Enlil, it is the river Tigris, did it not bring sweet water? To the house its king spoke: “I will make the ‘me’ of Eninnu emerge in heaven and on earth. The governor is wise, he shall pay attention. He shall enlarge big things. He shall straighten the horns of perfect oxen, perfect goats.” The brick of deciding destinies lifted the head towards him, to build the shiny house it raised its neck towards him. It was then, in a ‘dark goat’, that towards his king, on the lord Ningirsu, Gudea looked. “Build his house!,” he ordered him. On Eninnu, whose ‘me’ is very large, he (Ningirsu) directed his (Gudea’s) eye there. Gudea, his ‘heart’ is distant, counseled about the message: “Let me, let me tell it to her, let me, let me tell it to her, may she stand by me in this case. I am the shepherd, princeliness was given to me. Of what my ‘dark goat’ has revealed to me, its ‘heart’ I did not know. Let me bring my dream to her, to my mother. My dream-interpreter, knowing ‘ku3’ on her own, Nanše, my divine sister from Siraran, may she make its meaning visible for me.” Did he not set foot on his barge? Towards Nina, her city, on Ininadua, he directed the barge, he is breaking the waves of Ideḫula. After reaching Bagara—house hanging over the river, he sacrificed bread, he poured out cold water, he went to the king of Bagara, and prayed to him: “Hero, charging lion, having no rival, Ningirsu, boisterous in the Apsû, being noble in Nippur. Hero, you spoke to me, let me do it right for you, Ningirsu, let me build your house for you, let me make the ‘me’ perfect for you. Your sister, child born to Eridu, hero in her own right, lady-dream-interpreter of the gods, Nanše, my divine sister from Siraran, may she place the path for me.” His (Gudea’s) prayer was being heard. From Gudea, his offering and his prayer, his king, the lord Ningirsu, received from him. In the House of Bagara he celebrated the week-festival. The governor set up his bed in the house of Gatumdu. He sacrificed bread, he poured out cold water. He went to Shiny-Gatumdu, (and then) he is saying an offering(!) to her: “My lady, child born by shiny An, princely in her own right, god with the raised head, living in the land, knowing ‘nig2-du7’ in her city. You are the lady, the mother, founder of Lagash. (With) your looking at the people: it is a bountiful wind. (With) your looking at the righteous hero, the man: for him life is prolonged. I am a no-mother-haver, you are my mother. I am a no-father-haver, you are my father. You have placed my semen in the inside: you bore me in the cella. Gatumdu, your shiny name is sweet. I will lay me down here this night, you are my big dagger, following my side. You are a reed, planted in the big water, you have placed life in me. You are a broad parasol, under your shade let me cool myself there. With the index finger? of your right hand, ‘stroke’ me with it my lady Gatumdu. I will go to the city, may my sign be good. To Nina, mountain raising out of the sea, may your good Utukku go in front of me, may your good Lamma follow me on my path. Let me, let me tell it to her. Let me, let me tell it to her. May she stand by me in this case. Let me bring my dream to my mother, my dream-interpreter knowing ‘ku3’ by herself, Nanše, my divine lady from Siraran, may she make its meaning visible for me.” His cry was heard. His lady, the offering and the prayer, Shiny-Gatumdu received from Gudea. Did he not place the foot on the barge? To her city, Nina, he moored at the port of Nina. In the courtyard of the deity of Siraran the governor raised the head to heaven, he sacrificed bread, he poured out cold water. He went to Nanše, he prayed to her: “Nanše, large lady, lady of precious, precious, ‘me’. Lady, like Enlil deciding destinies. My Nanše, your word is righteous, it goes to the top. You are the dream interpreter of the gods. You are the lady of all the lands. Mother, my words, in the day, in the dream. Inside the dream there was one man, his greatness was like heaven, his greatness was like the earth. He, according to his head he was a god, according to his arm he was the Anzu, according to his lower body he was the flood. Lions lay by his right and left. He spoke to me about the building of his house. His ‘heart’ I did not understand. A light went up on the horizon for me. There was one woman. Who was it, who was it not? going up to the top she made a haystack on the earth. She held a stylus of purified silver in the hand. She had the tablet of the stars on her lap. She counseled it. Secondly, it was a hero, he bent the arm, he held a lapis writing board in the hand, he drew the plan of the house. In front of me stood a shiny basket, a shiny mold was made ready, the brick of deciding destinies was placed in the mold for me. In a just poplar standing in front of me, a ‘tibu’-bird passed the time tweeting. A donkey stallion, on the right side of my king, scratched the earth for me.” His mother, Nanše, answered the governor: “My shepherd, let me, me interpret your dream for you. The man (who was) great like the heaven, (who was) great like the earth, (who) according to his head (he was a) god, according to his arm (he was) the Anzu, according to his lower body the flood, at (whose) right and left lions were lying, it is surely my brother Ningirsu. ‘Build his shrine, the Eninnu!’ He ordered you. The light that went up for you on the horizon, it is your god Ningešzida, who like the light went up for you on the horizon. The virgin, going up to the top, making a haystack on the earth, holding a stylus of purified silver in her hand, placing the tablet of the stars on the lap, counseled it. That is surely Nisaba, my sister. (About) the shiny star of the building of the house, she poured out her voice for you. The second (one), it was a hero, with bent arm, holding in the hand a lapis drawing board, it is Nindubba, placing the house on the plan of the house. The shiny basket standing in front of you, the prepared shiny mold, the brick of deciding destinies, placed in the mold, that is surely the righteous brick of Eninnu. In the righteous poplar standing in front of you, a ‘tibu’-bird passed time tweeting, in order not to let sweet sleep come to your eyes, (so) that the house is build. A donkey stallion scratching the ground on your kings right side, that is you, scratching the ground for Eninnu like a ‘choice’ (?) (donkey-)span (?). Let me give give you instructions, let my instructions be heeded. (When) you have reached Girsu, the chief house of Lagash: after you broke the seal of your treasure house, after your brought out wood, after your have prepared a chariot for your king, after you harnessed the donkey stallion, after you decorated this chariot with purified silver and lapis, (called) ‘quick as light the arrow go out from the quiver’, after you have cared for ‘Ankara’, the ‘arm of heroism’, after you have fashioned his beloved emblem, after you wrote your name on it, his beloved harp, ‘dragon of the land’, the famous roaring wood, with which he counsels, to the hero who loves gifts, to your king, lord Ningirsu, after you entered for him into Eninnu, ‘the white Anzu bird’, with it, he will receive your small word, as if it was a mighty word. The ‘heart’ of the lord, distant like the heavens, of Ningirsu, son of Enlil, he will calm for you. He will reveal the plan of his house to you. The hero, his ‘me’ are the greatest, he shall let it grow for you.” The righteous shepherd Gudea learnt big, and now he will perform big. To the word Nanše spoke to him, he bowed his head. He broke the seal of his treasure house, he brought out wood. Gudea stood by the wood, he is caring for the wood. He made the top of the ‘mes’ wood good. He put the oak wood to the axe. He made it straight for him, for the lapis chariot. The donkey stallion, ‘lion called for running’, he harnesses for it. He fashioned his beloved emblem for him, he wrote his name on it. With his beloved harp, ‘dragon of the land’, the famous roaring wood, with which he councels, to the hero loving gifts, to his king, lord Ningirsu, in Eninnu, the white Anzu, he enters. Joyfully he entered to him in the house. Didn’t Gudea go out, brilliantly, from the shrine Eninnu? For the second (time), in(?) the house he passed the days, he passed the nights. He flattened the hills, he returned accusations. He removed the spittle from the dagger. To Šugalam, the terrible place, the place of rendering justice, the place of Ningirsu’s looking on all the lands, the governor, fattened(?) sheep, fat-tail sheep, fattened goats, un-fertilized sheep, in their hides, he brought in. Juniper, the pure tree of the mountain he placed on the fire, cedar incense, the incense of the gods, its smoke he made. He rose for his king in public, he prayed to him, he went to him in ‘ubšu-ukkina’, he greeted him: “My king, Ningirsu, lord holding back the terrible water, righteous lord, semen poured out by the ‘great mountain’. I am the youth not possessing guilt (?). Ningirsu, I will build your house for you, (but) my sign is my not. Hero you poured out the voice to me about the old order, son of Enlil, lord Ningirsu, I don’t understand its ‘heart’, your ‘heart’, surging, like the ocean, your, receding, like the wave, your roaring, like cascading water, like a flood, your crushing of cities, like the storm, your smashing of rebel lands, my king, your whirling water which cannot be held back, your ‘heart’. Hero, your remote, like the heaven, ‘heart’, son of Enlil, lord Ningirsu, I, what can I learn from you?” For the second (time), to the sleeping, to the sleeping, he stood by his head, he is touching his dagger: “(That which) you are building for me, (that which) you are building for me, Governor, the house you are building for me, Gudea, I will surely give you the sign of the building of my house. The shiny star of my ‘garza’ I will certainly proclaim for you. My house, Eninnu, founded by An, its ‘me’ is bigger than all the other enormous ‘me’ The king of the house gazes far. Like the Anzu, its shriek, makes the heaven tremble. Its terrible radiance reaches the heaven. The big fear of my house is spread on all the lands. At its name all the lands gather at the horizon. Magan (and) Meluhha will descend from their land. I Ningirsu, holding back the terrible water, the big hero in the place of Enlil, having no rival, I, the lord, have made my house, the Eninnu, bigger than a mountain. My weapon, ‘multitude-eraser’, which places the mountain in the hand, my terrible eye, which the lands cannot sustain, no-one shall leave my out-going out arm. My father and begetter, with love of greatness, the king, flood of Enlil, the border lands cannot sustain his terrible eye, Ningirsu, hero of Enlil, as name he named me. I collected the fifty ‘me’. I raised the offering table, I straightened the ‘šuluh’, I will raise my straightened hand to the shiny heaven for abundance: the things of my hand are sweetness. My father and begetter ate the sweetness, An, king of the gods, ‘Ningirsu, king, priest of An’, as name he named me. Tiraš, like Abzu, he founded in princeliness. Within it, with (each) moon, on the new moon day, he perfected for me greatly the very large ‘me’, my heavenly festival. Ehuš my Kihuš, like the Mušhuš(u-dragon?), he built on a frightening place. my rebellious place, which is not argued against, when my ‘heart’ has become angry with it, it produces poison for me like a poisonous snake. Ebabbar, place of my decisions, place of my sun-like shining, on that spot, I straighten the (law) cases of my city like Ištaran. In the house Bagara, the place of my table, the great gods of Lagash, assemble for me. My house, ‘chief house of all lands’, ‘right arm of Lagash’, ‘Anzu shrieking in all of heaven’, ‘Eninnu, my royal house’, righteous shepherd, Gudea, when your righteous hand caries it out, (when) you call the heaven for rain, I will let bounty come to you from the heaven. May people stretch out the hand in bounty with you. With the founding of my house, may abundance arrive. The great fields will lift the hand for you. The canals and the ditches will overflow their banks for you. Mounds that are never submerged, will be submerged for you. Sumer will pour out oil in excess with you, will weigh out wool in excess for you. When you place my platform for me, when you put your righteous hand to my house, the mountain, the place where the North-Wind rests, (when) you have reached it, the excessively strong male, the North-Wind, from the Mountain, the pure place, will straighten a wind for you. After I have given life to the people, a solitary man will work with another. At midnight the moon goes up for you, at midday the abundance of the sun goes up for you. I will build the house for you at day, at night I will let it grow for you. From below: oak, ‘peace’-tree will I bring down(!) to you. From above: cedar šurme-wood, zabalum-wood, by itself, from(?) the ebony-land, I will bring ebony for you. In the land of stone, large boulders of stone from the mountains, I will cut into blocks for you. On that day (when) your arm is touched with fire, I will teach you my sign.” Gudea rose, it was a dream. He is afraid, it was a dream. To Ningirsu’s spoken word, he bowed the head. He is stretching the hand in a white goat. He struck the hand into the goat, his goat is good. For Gudea, the ‘heart’ of Ningirsu it is the light, that dawned on him. He learned big, and now he will perform big. The governor, in his city, like a solitary man he regulated the rites. area-Lagash makes its ‘heart’ like one for him, like one mothers sons. He tore up trees, he weeded. He pruned, he returned accusations. He returned ‘sin’ to its house. He loosened the tongue of the whip (and) the [...], wool from a pregnant sheep he placed in the hand (of the overseer). A mother does not accuse a son, accusations, a son to his mother does not speak. The slave whose arm was touched by wood, his king does not smash his head. The slave girl, who a man wickedly made into booty, her lady did not thrown stuff in her face. To the governor, building Eninnu, to Gudea, no man brought accusations. The governor cleansed the city, he spun it with fire. An impure, a terrible one, a leper(?), he brought out from the city. He laid down the goat by the box, the mold, he made the brick appear by the goat, he gazed righteously at the tooth of the hoe. The shepherd named by Nanše performed in princeliness, his box, the mold, that he drew on, his tooth of the hoe, that he placed in princeliness, it is Anzu, his royal emblem, he made it shine as a sign. (For the) platform, he cleanses 24 ‘iku’ of the city for him, he purifies the platform for him. Juniper, the pure plant of the mountain, he placed on the fire, The cedar incense, the scent of the gods, its smoke he made. He spent the day with offerings and prayers to him. He passed the night greeting him. The Anunna of area-Lagash, in order to build the house of Ningirsu, with Gudea in offering and prayer, they stood with him. (For) the righteous shepherd Gudea, as something joyful, it was placed there. On that day, the governor arranged a levy in his land, in the totality of all of his lands. In the Gu'edina of Ningirsu he placed a levy. In the established city, in her settlements, in the Gugešbara of Nanše, he placed a levy. ‘The terrible, raised ox, having no rival,’ ‘the white cedar, seized for its king,’ in the ‘tribe’ of Ningirsu, he made a levy for him. Its mighty emblem, ‘the king crushes the foriegn lands’, standing at the head. ‘Where there is a bank, where there is a turtle-back-island, going out from the water,’ ‘the great river with much water, spreading its abundance’ in the ‘tribe’ of Nanše, he made a levy for him. The shiny u-(bird), it is the emblem of Nanše, went at its head. ‘A goat and donkey cord, spread out on the plain,’ ‘the famous first-class team, the beloved team of Utu,’ in the ‘tribe’ of Inanna, he made a levy for him. The sun-disk, it is the emblem of Inanna, went at its head. About the construction of the house of Ningirsu, Elam came to him from Elam. Elam came to him from Elam. Elam came to him from Elam. Susa came to him from Susa. Magan and Meluhha, from their land, submitted to him. For the construction of Nigirsu’s house, they assembled for Gudea in his city Girsu. He gave instructions to Ninzaga: “Its copper, like bringing much grain, to Gudea, man, builder of the house, he shall approach it to him.” He gave instructions to Ninsikila: “large oaks, ebony, mangrove-wood, to the governor, builder of the Eninnu, he shall approach it to him.” To the land of cedar, where no man enters, for Gudea, the Lord Ningirsu made way for him. He cut down its cedars with the great axe. Into the ‘multitude-eraser’, the right arm of Lagash, the weapon, ‘flood of his king’, he split it with the axe. It is a mighty snake floating on the water. From the cedar mountains, cedar beams, from the cypress mountain, cypress beams, from the ‘zabalum’ mountain, ‘zabalum’ beams, very large ‘usuh’ trees, ‘tubulum’ trees, ‘eranum’ trees, their large beams, in their floating, by the mighty port of Kasura, Gudea for the Lord Ningirsu moored them for him. To the land of stone, where no man enters, Gudea for the Lord Ningirsu made way for him. Its large stones, in blocks, he brought, In a ‘ha'una’ boat, in a ‘nalu'a’ boat, excavated(?) bitumen, ‘igiesir’ bitumen, gypsum, from the mountain of Madga, goods, like ships bringing of the barley of the field, Gudea to Lord Ningirsu moored it for him. For the governor, builder of the Eninnu, he raised the hand for big things. From Kimaš, the mountain of copper, (that) revealed itself to him, the copper he excavated there in its excess basket(?) For the man, building his kings house, for the governor, gold from its mountain, in its dust was brought to him. Purified silver is being brought down for Gudea from its mountain. Carneol, like flowers, from Meluhha, it is being made plentiful for him. From the alabaster land, alabaster is brought down to him. The shepherd, building the house in silver, sitting with the silversmith. He will build Eninnu with precious stones, sitting with the stonecutter, He will build in copper and antimony? The priest-smith(?), Nintukalamma will straighten in front of him. The ‘double-hand’ stone, the storm, shrieked for to him. Diorite the ‘hand’ stone, He made the days long for him, He made the days long for him, He made the days long for him, He made the days long for him, he made the nights long for him. Concerning the building of his king’s house, he does not allow sleep to enter during midnight, he does not set his head to sleep during midday. It is him, looked righteously at by Nanše, It is him, the man who is in Enlil’s ‘heart’, It is him, the governor chosen in the ‘heart’ by Enlil, It is him, Gudea, born in the lofty cella by Gatumdu. Nisaba, the house of wisdom, she opened for him. Enki made the plan of the house right for him. (To) the house, its radiance reaches heaven, its ‘me’ embraces heaven and earth, its king, the lord carrying a terrible gaze, its expert in war, the hero Ningirsu, to Eninnu, the white Anzu, Gudea, from below walked to it, to high, on the platform of fire, from high he walked to it, to below, on the platform of fire, the field was right, he measured it, he placed sticks on its border, he knew himself. Like something joyful established for him, It is morning, he went in prayer to the old house. Gudea, at Baragirnunata calmed his ‘heart’. The day passed, he bathed. He fixated himself. Utu went up for him in abundance. For the second time Gudea went out of the shiny city, he sacrificed perfect oxen and perfect goats, he went to the house, he prayed there. The shiny basket, the righteous mold of deciding destinies, he raised to Eninnu. He tied a sinew to the hoe, he went with raised head. Lugalkurdub went in front of him, Igalim places the road for him, (and) Ningešzida, his god, leads him by the hand. He did ‘asaga’ in the mold. The ‘adab’, ‘sim’, and ‘ala’ were played for the governor. He flattened the top of the brick with the tooth of the hoe. He greased it with honey, butter oil, and fine butter oil. Incense and resin from various trees he made into a paste. He raised the shiny basket, he stood by the mold. Gudea placed clay in the mold. The cultic order emerged. The emergence of the brick of the house was placed. Foreigners sprinkle oil with him, sprinkle cedar (oil) with him. His city, area-Lagash, in happiness(?) passes the day with him. He shook the mold, he threw the brick to dry. On its firing(?) he looked righteously. incense, apples, and resin he smeared on its top. (About) his brick placed in the mold, Utu was pleased with it. (About) his ‘agari’ which rises like a mighty river, King Enki decided its destiny for him. He placed the brick, he brought the mold into the house, he lifted the brick from the mold, it is a shiny throne raised to heaven. He raised the brick, he brought it to his people, it is the shiny team of Utu shaking its head. The brick raising its head to the house, it is the cow of Nanna, whose pen is shining, He placed the brick, he walks in the house. She is establishing the plan of the house, it is Nisaba whose ‘heart’ knows counting. Like a young man building a new house, he does not allow sweet sleep to enter his eyes. Like a cow whose eye are on its calf, he walked to the house in great concern. Like a man with (only) little food in the mouth, he is not resting in his walking. (That) his king’s ‘heart’ is the light (of the vision) dawned (on him). For Gudea, the word of Ningirsu is the sign he was building (under), in his ‘heart’ yearning for the building of the house, a man gave me a good omen. It was placed like something joyful for him, he stretched his hand in the goat, his goat was good. He gave grain to the wave, its appearance was straight. Gudea lying by the top, he slept, the word dawned on him. To build his king’s house, the separation of Eninnu from heaven and earth, was brought to his attention. It was placed like something joyful for him. He threw the flax, he perfected the me. The shiny‘ uzga’ sustains the shrine. Enki places the foundation of the house, Nanše, the daughter of Eridu cared for the omen taking. The mother of Lagash, Shiny-Gatumdu, bore its bricks in flows. Baba, the lady, firstborn of An, was sprinkling oil and cedar oil there. The En and Lagar stood in the house, they performed the me. The Annunaki stood there admiring. Gudea, builder of the house, he placed the basket of the house, a shiny crown, on the head, he placed the foundation, the wall touched the ground, he gave a blessing, he stroked the brick with flax. For the second (time) did he not give a blessing in the house? It is flax in bloom placed on the top. For the third (time) did he not give a blessing in the house? It is Anzu spreading its wings over the calfs. For the fourth (time) did he not give a blessing in the house? It is a young lion embracing a terrible lion. For the fifth (time) did he not give a blessing in the house? It is the green sky, lifting terrifying radiance. For the sixths (time) did he not give a blessing in the house? It is the dawn dressed in joy. For the seventh (time) did he not give a blessing in the house? It is Eninnu—Moon passing (through)—filling the land. They place the wood of the door. It is the green sky lifting the crown. From the wood of the door [...]. It is the lofty house embracing the heaven. He build the house, he planted the tree. It is the trough of Nanna, the [...] of Enki. They make the house grow like a mountain. They make it float in the middle of the heaven like a cloud. They make it raise its hors like an ox.

The cut down reed of the house is snakes coiled up in the mountain. The mountain is moist cedar decorated with apples. They placed white cedar to be admired in the ‘cedar hall’. They cared for it with good resin and fine butter oil. The E-imdua was decorated with the fertility of Abzu. they made the drains hang down. Shrine-Eninnu it is placed in the hand of the x of heaven. The governor built the house, he made it grow, he made it grow like a large mountain, he placed the very large mast, the foundation, its Abzu, in the ground. With Enki, in E'angurraka, he counseled with him there. The foundation, ‘a hero in heaven’, he seized in the house; it drinks water at the drinking place of the gods. He made Eninnu firm as a mast. He built its Abgal. He planted sweet Asal trees in his city, he stretched out their shadow. He placed the ‘multitude-eraser’, like a great sign, with Lagash He placed it in Šugalam, its terrible place, Having goosebumps in Baragirnunna, the place of rendering justice. The provider for Lagash raises the arm like a great ox. His large stones brought in their blocks, he brought them in a single year, he worked them in a single year, he did not let two, three days pass for them, one each day’s work he erected, on the seventh day he seized them in the house. A stone on its side he laid down as a basin, he formed it with incense, he placed them in the house. His stone erected in the mighty courtyard, ‘the stela, king filling the courtyard, Lord Ningirsu made Gudea known from Girnun,’ as name of that stone he named. His stone erected in Kasurra, ‘the king, flood of Enlil, no-haver of opponent, Lord Ningirsu, on Gudea looked righteously,’ as name of that stone he named.

For Ninhursaga, the lady who grew up with the city, the mother of all children, his lady, Gudea, ruler of Lagash, her temple of the city Girsu he built for her. Her sacred treasure chest he constructed for her. Her great throne of queenship he constructed for her, and into her Great Temple he had it brought to her. From the mountains of Magan he had diorite brought down, and into (this) his stone figure he formed it. The lady who would determine the fates in heaven and earth, Nintu, the mother of the gods, of Gudea, the man who built the temple, his life she shall prolong, he named it for her, and into the temple he had it brought to her. Within the temple of Ningirsu his master-for the statue of Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, the man by whom the Eninnu temple was built, one sila3 of beer, one sila3 of bread, one half sila3 of heaping-flour and one half sila3 of emmer groats, being the regular offering existing for it, a (future) ruler who shall revoke it and who the divine power of Ningirsu shall thereby diminish, may his regular offerings within the temple of Ningirsu be revoked and all his pronouncements be blocked! For Ningirsu, strong hero of Enlil, Gudea, he of lasting fame, ruler of Lagash, the shepherd chosen by the heart of Ningirsu, regarded favorably by Nanše, given might by Nindara, a person subject to the word of Baba, child born by Gatumdug, given authority and a great scepter by Igalima, richly provided with encouragement by Šulšaga, rightful head of the assembly come forth in splendor of Ningešzida his (personal) god, when Ningirsu had directed his righteous gaze towards his city, and Gudea he had chosen as the rightful shepherd in the nation, and out of 36,000 people had taken him by the hand, he (Gudea) sanctified the city and refined it with fire. He set up the brick mold, and chose the (first) brick by kid-omen. The sexually impure persons who inspire fear, the [...] man, he with a shriveled(?) penis, and the woman who had been in labor(?), he sent out of the city. Women did not carry the earth baskets for it, (only) the chief warriors did the building for him. The temple of Ningirsu like (the city) Eridu in a clean place he built. There was no beating with whips nor beating with leather straps. No mother hit her child with anything. The military governors, overseers, foremen, those who performed worker levies, while stationed at the work (as light as) wool under the carding comb was the disciplining he put into their hands. No pickax was used in the cemetery of the city, no corpse was buried. The lamentation singer did not play the harp or bring forth laments, The wailing women did not perform wailing. Within the territory of Lagash, a person having a lawsuit to the place of oath-taking did not make another person go, and a creditor did not enter another person's house. For Ningirsu his master he (Gudea) made a fitting thing come forth resplendently, (namely) his temple Eninnu with a white thunderbird he built for him and restored for him. In the center of it his beloved high terrace with aromatic cedar he built for him. When the temple of Ningirsu he built, Ningirsu, his master who loved him, from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea opened up the roads for him. From the Amanus, the mountain range of cedar, cedars whose length was sixty cubits, cedars whose length was fifty cubits, and boxwood whose length was twenty-five cubits, he made into planks and brought them down from their mountains. Levels the Multitudes, his storm of battle, he constructed for him, and Slaughters the Multitudes, his copper seven-faced peg, he constructed for him. His copper peg of a side-ax he constructed for him, and his copper peg of an allul-ax he constructed for him. Those cedars into big doors he fashioned, decorated them with sacred flowers, and into the Eninnu he had them brought for him. In his lofty temple where cold water would be poured, he (also) set them as roof-beams for him. From the city of Ursu and the mountain range of Ebla juniper, big firs, and plane trees, mountain trees, he made into planks, and in the Eninnu he set them as roof-beams for him. From Umanum, the mountain range of Menua, and from Busala, the mountain range of the Martu, big stones he brought down. Into steles he fashioned them, and in the courtyard of the Eninnu he erected them for him. From Tidanum, the mountain range of the Martu, alabaster in blocks he brought in, and into destroying lions he fashioned them, and as gate bolts he mounted them in the temple. In Abullat, the mountain range of Kimaš, he mined copper, and into the Mace Which the World Quarters Cannot Bear he fashioned it for him. From the land of Meluhha he brought down ebony, and erected(?) it for him. A block of nir-stone he brought down, and into a mace with three lion heads he fashioned it for him. Gold in its ore from the mountain range of Hahum he brought down, and onto the mace with three lion heads he overlaid it for him. Gold in its ore from the land of Meluhha he brought down, and into a quiver he fashioned it for him. Zebus he brought down. From Gubin the land of oak(?) trees, oak(?) he brought down, and into the bird (named) Levels the Multitudes he fashioned it. From Madga, the mountain range of the ordeal river, a myriad of talents of bitumen he brought down, and in the platform of the Eninnu he used it for construction. Ha'um-clay be brought down. From the mountain range of Barme many stones into big boats he loaded, and he placed them around the base of the Eninnu. The cities of Anšan and Elam with weapons he smote, and the booty from them to Ningirsu into the Eninnu he had brought in. Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, when the Eninnu he had built for Ningirsu, he made it as a (lasting) treasure. A temple fashioned like this not a single ruler for Ningirsu had ever built. But he (Gudea) did indeed build it. He inscribed (his) name, and made (this) fitting thing come forth resplendently. To the commands of Ningirsu he set forth a faithful hand. From the land of Magan he brought down diorite and into (this) stone figure he formed it. For my master his temple I built, (so) life is my reward, (was how) he named it for him, and into the Eninnu he had it brought to him. Gudea to the statue gives (these) words: Statue, to my master do say thus: When the Eninnu, his beloved temple, I built for him, I had debts remitted and I washed all hands. For seven days no barley was ground. The slave woman was made equal with her mistress, and by the slave his master stood side by side. In my city the sexually impure with respect to him (Ningirsu) I made to go out to sleep at the edge of it. Evil to its house I made go back. To the laws of Nanše and Ningirsu I attended. An orphan I did not let be put under the control of a rich person. and a widow I did not let be put under the control of a powerful person. For an estate not having a son, a daughter of it its heir I made become. The stone statue he made receptive to messages. This statue is neither of silver, nor is it of lapis lazuli. It is neither of copper nor of tin, nor is it of bronze. No one must put it to any other use, and so it is (made only of) diorite. Let it stand at the place of libations. By an act of force let no one destroy it. O statue, before you is (standing a statue) of Ningirsu! The statue of Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, the man by whom the Eninnu of Ningirsu was built-any person who from the Eninnu shall remove it, or its inscription shall erase from it, or any person who shall destroy it; at the beginning of a good year, a (future) person whom, as did my god, his (own) god Ningirsu, my master, has called to from among all the people, who (then) my judgments shall overturn, my gifts would revoke, and from my collected songs having displaced my name shall set his own name on them; who in the courtyard of Ningirsu my master shall abandon its established shrines, without having kept before his eyes that since days of old, since the seed (first) emerged, when a ruler of Lagash, the Eninnu for Ningirsu my master had built-being a person who had made a fitting thing come forth resplendently-his words no one shall ever alter, nor ever overturn his judgments. Therefore regarding Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, anyone who shall alter his word, or shall overturn his judgments, may An, Enlil, Ninhursaga, Enki, he of the righteous utterance, Suen, whose name no one can explain, Ningirsu, the king of weaponry, Nanše, the mistress of the boundary marker, Nindara, the king and warrior, the mother of Lagash the holy Gatumdu, Baba, the lady, the eldest daughter of An, Inanna, the lady of battle, Utu, the king of greenery, Hendursag, the herald of the nation, Igalima and Šulšagana, Ninmar, the eldest daughter of Nanše, Dumuzi'abzu, the mistress of Kinunir, and my (personal) god Ningešzida, may they all change his fate. Like an ox may he be slaughtered in his noonday (prime). Like an aurochs may he be seized by his fierce horns. May his throne which people had set up for him be made to sit out in the dust. If to erasing this inscription he should set his mind, let his own name in the house of his god from the tablets be removed. May his own god not look upon the settled(?) people. May he hold back the rain in the sky and hold back the waters upon the earth. May years of dearth stretch out for him, and may there be famine during his reign. That person, like a man who does evil to a righteous person, may that one’s end produce a shutting(?) in heaven, and may it not be released. Of the most forceful of all the gods, of lord Ningirsu, may his greatness be known by the nation. Ningešzida is the (personal) god of Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, the man by whom the Eanna (temple) was built. For Inana, the mistress of all the lands, his mistress, Gudea, he of lasting fame, the ruler of Lagash, the man by whom the Eninnu of Ningirsu was built-when Inana her eye of life she had sent out towards him, Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, being of broad intelligence and a slave by his mistress beloved, in the shed of the brick mold he made the design, and by the excavation he made the standards gleam. The clay for it on a pure place he mixed together, and the bricks for it onto a clean place he let fall out. Its foundation plot he sanctified and refined with fire. Its foundation pegs with oil of princely scent he adorned. Her beloved temple, the Eanna, in the center of Girsu he built for her. From the mountains of Magan he brought down diorite and into (this) his stone figure he formed it. Gudea, the temple builder, may his life be long! he named it for her, and into the Eanna he had it brought to her. A person who from the Eanna shall remove it, or who shall destroy it, or erase its inscription, Inana, the mistress of all the lands, his head in the assembly may she curse. The throne that he has erected, its foundations may she not keep secure. May she make his seed come to an end and cut short his reign. For Ningirsu, the mighty warrior of Enlil, his master. Gudea, ruler of Lagash, he of lasting fame, who tows the boat of Enlil, shepherd chosen by the heart of Ningirsu, the strong steward of Nanše, a man subject to the word of Baba, child born by Gatumdu, given authority and a great scepter by Igalima, broadly provided with encouragement by Šulšagana, a righteous man wbo loves his city, he made a fitting thing come forth resplendently for him, (namely) his Eninnu temple with the white eagle he built for him. In the middle of it his beloved high terrace he built for him with aromatic cedar, and his E-PA, the temple with seven corners, he built for him. Within it, the bridal gifts for Baba, his mistress, he provided in proper fashion. His beloved procession barge, Gone Forth from the Princely Quay, he constructed for him (Ningirsu), and at the Lapis Lazuli Quay of the Kasura gate he moored it for him. Its boatmen and their captain he assembled for him, and to the temple of his master he presented them. For Baba, the beautiful woman, the daughter of An, his mistress, her temple of the Holy City he built. By the power of Nanše, and by the power of Ningirsu, to Gudea, given the scepter by Ningirsu, Magan, Meluhha, Gubin, and the land Dilmun, (lands) which had produced loads of timber for him, their boats built of (these) timbers to Lagash they brought to him. From the mountain range of Magan he brought down diorite, and into (this) stone figure he formed it. The king whose heavy arm the foreign lands cannot bear, Ningirsu, for Gudea the man of the temple building, has decreed regarding him a good fate, (so) he named it, and into the Eninnu he had it brought to him. (This is a statue of) Gudea, the ruler of Lagash. For Baba, the beautiful woman, daughter of An, queen of the Holy City, lady of abundance, lady who decrees the fates in Girsu, lady who is the judge of her city, lady who loves (her) servants, lady of things that have been lost, his mistress, Gudea, ruler of Lagash, the man by whom the Eninnu (temple) of Ningirsu and the PA-house, the seven-corner house, was built-When Baba, his mistress, had chosen him by her sacred heart, being a slave who reveres his mistress, the greatness of his mistress he did proclaim. To the cultic practices of Baba, his mistress, he did attend. Like the things (he had done) when the Eninnu, his beloved temple, for Ningirsu his master he had built, when for Baba, the daughter of An, the queen of the Holy City, his mistress, the Etarsirsir, her beloved temple, he built, he sanctified the city and refined it with fire. In the shed of the brick mold he drew the design. and by the excavation he made the standards gleam. The clay for it in a pure place he mixed, and its (first) brick onto a clean place he let fall out. He put bricks into the molds, and made a fitting thing come forth resplendently. He sanctified its foundation plot and refined it with fire. Its foundation pegs with oil of princely scent he adorned. For Baba, his mistress, the queen of the Holy City, she who inspires with awe, in the Holy City, on a pure place, he built the temple. Her great throne of queenship he fashioned for her, and in her place of rendering judgment he set it up for her. Her sacred treasure chest he fashioned for her, and for her Exalted House he had in brought in for her. The harp (named) The Lady Excels with An he fashioned for her, and in her exalted courtyard he set it up for her. On New Year's Day, the festival of Baba, when the bridal gifts are to be performed, 1 grain-fed ox, 1 tallow sheep, 3 grain-fed sheep, 6 rams, 2 lambs, 7 kur-measures of dates, 7 jars of butter oil, 7 hearts of palm, 7 [...] of figs, 7 baskets (of dates?) 1 [...]-bird 7 cranes 15 geese, 60 small birds whose strings are 15, 60 crates of fresh carp their strings being 30, 30 talents of turnips, 7 talents of [...]-grain 60 talents of willow sticks-(all these) were the bridal gifts for Baba in the old temple of former days.

With the temple of Baba having been restored, with its abundance having been made to come forth resplendently, with the throne of Lagash's foundation having been made secure, with Gudea the ruler of Lagash's scepter of true words resting in his hand, and his life's days having been extended, together with his (personal) god Ningešzida to Baba into her temple of the Holy City he entered with all this to her. In the middle of that year, from the mountains of Magan he brought down diorite, and into (this) stone figure he formed it. My lady, you raised me up for it. Grant life! On the day commanded for it I did build it! (so) he named it for her, and into the temple he had it brought to her. (This) is a statue of the man by whom the temple of Baba was built. From its standing-place no one shall remove it! The regular offerings for it no one shall reduce! (This is a statue of) Gudea, the ruler of Lagash. For Gatumdu, the mother of Lagash, Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, the dog of Gatumdu, your beloved slave, the man who made a fitting thing come forth resplendently, (namely) by whom the Eninnu with the white eagle of Ningirsu was built, to whom Gatumdu, his mistress, within Lagash her beloved city, in the bright private chamber gave birth-In order the temple of Gatumdu his mistress to build, he did not sleep. Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, being of broad intelligence and a slave who reveres his mistress, in the shed of the brick mold he drew the design, and by the excavation he made the standards gleam. The clay for it on a holy place he mixed, and its (first) brick on a clean place he let fall out. Its foundation plot he sanctified and refined with fire. Its foundation pegs with oil of princely scent he adorned. In the Holy City in a pure place he built the temple for her. Her great throne of queenship he fashioned for her.

In fine goats he made fine kids to multiply, and their shepherds he made follow out after them. Among the jennies the swift jackasses he set free, and their herdsmen he made follow after them.

The bridal gifts which gladden the heart, Ningirsu, for Baba, the daughter of An, his beloved wife, he performs therein, while his (Gudea's personal) god Ningešzida followed after them. Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, from Girsu to the Holy City constantly spoke greetings.
