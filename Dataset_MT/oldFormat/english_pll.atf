When the city of Inab already existed but the city of Kiritab did not yet exist
When the holy crown already existed but the holy tiara did not yet exist
When the holy herb already existed but the holy cedar did not yet exist
When holy salt already existed but holy alkali did not yet exist
When intercourse and kissing already existed
When giving birth in the fields already existed 
I was the grandfather of the holy cedar I was the ancestor of the mesh tree
I was the mother and father of the white cedar I was the relative of the hashur cedar
At that time there was a princely land among the cities
Inab was this princely land among the cities
The ruler of Inab was Tigishemala
Now he had a wife whose name was Shagegur Desiredbytheheart
and a child who  
and her name was 
The people living around the city hung up nets
the people living around Inab hung up nets
hung up nets chased gazelles
killed the gazelles as one kills humans
One day as the evening came when they had reached
when they have reached the place of rations
they established the rations before the god 
The ration of a married man was established as double
the ration of a man with a child was established as triple
the ration of a single man was established as single
but the ration of Martu though being single was also established as double
Martu went home to his own mother
He entered the house before her and spoke to her
In my city I am among my friends and they all have already married wives
I am there among my mates and they all have already married wives
Unlike my friends in my city I am single
I am single and I have no children
Yet the imposed share exceeds that of my friends
over and above that of my mates I received half of theirs
One day as the evening came and they had reached again
the place of rations when they had reached it
they established the rations before the god 
The ration of a married man was established as double
the ration of a man with a child was established as triple
the ration of a single man was established as single
but the ration of Martu though he was single was also established as double
Martu to his own mother
he entered the house before her and spoke to her
My mother find me a wife to marry and I will bring you my ration
His own mother replied to Martu
Suenuna my son I will give you advice may my advice be heeded
I shall say a word to you you should pay attention to it
Marry a wife of your choice
marry a wife of your hearts desire
give me thus a companion  me a slavegirl
Having built the houses of  your people living around the city and  gardens
you will dig the wells of  your mates
Martu  mates 
At that time a festival was announced in the city
a festival was announced in the city of Inab Martu said
Come friends let us go let us go there
let us visit the alehouses of Inab let us go there
The god Numuda participated in the festival
his beloved daughter Adgarkidug participated in the festival
his wife Namrat the lovely woman participated in the festival
In the city bronze em drums were rumbling
and the seven ala drums resounded as strong men
girdled champions
entered the wrestling house 
to compete with each other in the temple of Inab
There were many coming to Inab the city where the festival was taking place to marvel at this
There were many coming to Inab the city where the festival was taking place to marvel at this
For Numuda because he was holy   
to compete in wrestling at the gate of Inab
Martu too strode around the great courtyard
They kept looking for strong fighters for him
they kept offering him strong fighters
Martu strode around in the great courtyard
He hit them  with a destructive  
In the great courtyard in the battle he caused them to be bandaged
in the great courtyard of Inab he lifted the bodies of the dead
Numushda rejoicing over Martu
offered him silver but he would not accept it
He offered jewels but he would not accept them
Having done so a second time
having done so a third time Martu says
Where does your silver lead Where do your jewels lead
I Martu would rather marry your daughter
I would rather marry your daughter Adgarkidug
Numuda says You  the wife with calves as a marriage gift 
Milk cows shall feed the calves
In the byre the breeding bull shall lie down
 cows shall live in the 
and the calves shall stay at their right side
You must give your word thus and only thus
and then I will give you my daughter Adgarkidug
You  the wife with lambs as a marriage gift
Milk ewes shall feed the lambs
In the sheepfold  shall lie down
 ewes shall live in the 
and the lambs shall stay at their left side
You must give your word thus and only thus
and then I will give you my daughter Adgarkidug
You  the wife with kids as a marriage gift

The goats and kids shall live in the

He  great 
He shouted like 
At the quay of Inab he 
The elders of Inab
he gratified with golden torcs
The old women of Inab
he gratified with golden shawl 
The men and women of Inab
he gratified with golden 
The slaves of Inab
he gratified with 
and with coloured  cloths
The slavegirls of Inab
he gratified with silver jugs
The days have multiplied no decision has yet been made
Adgarkidugs girlfriend speaks to her Now listen their hands are destructive and their features are those of monkeys
he is one who eats what Nanna forbids and does not show reverence
They never stop roaming about 
they are an abomination to the gods dwellings
Their ideas are confused they cause only disturbance
He is clothed in sackleather 
He lives in a tent exposed to wind and rain and cannot properly recite prayers
He lives in the mountains and ignores the places of gods
He digs up truffles in the foothills does not know how to bend the knee
He eats raw flesh
He has no house during his life
and when he dies he will not be carried to a burialplace

The dragonface is the dragonface of a man 
the dragonface of a man causing evil 
approached heaven and the clouds bring no rain 
He approached the earth and the plants do not grow 
He approached the ox and its yoke does not open
He approached the stall and smashes its cheesepot 
Utterances have passed by
He approached the lad and sapped his sexual energies 
he approached the maiden and tossed away her towel 
He approached the nurse with the child  her arms were torn apart
He approached the vegetables  lettuce and cress became bad
He approached the garden the fruit became bad
The eye of the mountain came out from the mountain
The wild ram let its shining horns come out
May the evil eye like the sick eye be cut off
May it split open like a leather bag
May it go to pieces like the potters burzipot on the market place
While standing while standing
while standing at the mouth of the street
it opposes the young man who has no personal god
Let the eye turn into a wind
Asar in Abzu
may he not undo it

He gathered up that which had been destroyed in the mountain and placed it in the Tigris 
He irrigated the meadow with the carp flood 
Now today that of the horizonentire earth everything 
The kings of the homeland profoundly rejoiced for Ninurta 
The field ripened withplaced barley 
The harvest of the irrigated orchard yielded fruit 
He heaped up the grain piles 
The lord brought up harborstrading colonies from within the land 
He made the mood of the gods pleasant 
And they were praising Ninurta and his father Enlil 
At that time he also reached a compassionate state for the woman 
Ninmah because of the place where  had sex with her was not sleeping 
She made her hair cover her back like a heavy ie unshorn ewe 
She was greatly intoning a lament in the mountain that had not been stepped onhad no trails 
The mountain does not bear the supreme strength of the lord 
The hero who like An in his anger his might no one approaches 
The furious storm that moves upon the earth depositing poison on its chest 
Lord the life of Enlil of whom the crown is appropriate upon his head 
The mountain shall make the livestock teem for you 
The mountain range shall make the quadrupeds proliferate for you 
You a lady with whose cosmic powers no other cosmic powers compare who wears a furiousreddish aura like heaven 
Digirmah who hates excessive speech 
The true lady Ninhursag the young woman 
Nintur who  when it cools in the evening 
Draw near lady I have given you supreme cosmic powers so that you shall be exaltedshall wield them 
True lady her cosmic powers surpass other cosmic powers lady carpenter of the womb 
Aruru the elder sister of Enlil stood at his front 
Great hero when you killed the hero 
Lord who like his father his utterance cannot be changed you have not yet decreed a fate 
The lord was speaking to the emery stone he was wishing forobserving its path 
In the homeland the angry lord spoke a word to him 
Ninurta lord son of Enlil was cursing him 
Emery stone you who the Asag mustered against me in the mountain 
As one who seized  in order to renderplace my hands  
As one who swore to commit my murder 
As one who terrified me lord Ninurta in my own supreme dwelling 
Mighty one youth possessed of form your surpassingness and you stature shall be diminished 
Leopards that rely on their strength shall tear you up 
The powerful one shall accept a test of strength with you 
Young man emery your brothers shall heap you like flour 
You young man your shout shall be present and tremble but it shall end 
You shall raise a hand violently against your offspring show the teeth against their corpses 
Like a great bull killed by many mena slaughterer make yourself intoset yourself apart as something divided into shares 
Emery by means of the weapon dog away from battle 
like something chased away by the junior shepherd 
I am the lord you shall be named according to your having pecked atdemolished carnelian 
Now this is the decreed fate of Ninurta 
Today and henceforth when emery touches another stone it will be in order to perforate carnelian thus it is so 
The hero was speaking to the uu and gasura stones 
My king attended to the eleli stone 
My king attended to the eleli stone 
Ninurta the son of Enlil was decreeing its fate 
eleli stone possessed of wisdom when the mountain sows discord I shall cast down my aura upon you 
Upon my rebel land whose people confront together you shall invoke my name 
You shall not diminish from your healthyintact state 
The reduction of your thickness shall be difficult 
My cosmic powers shall regulate your rites 
You shall be greatly suited for my smiting weapon which kills the hero 
In my supreme courtyard a pedestal shall be set down for you 
May the land admire you sweetly the foreign lands shall raise you 
The hero attended to the kagina stone 
He spoke to it because of its might 
Ninurta the son of Enlil was decreeing its fate 
Reverent youth who sets saturated light to the outside 
kagina stone you who put down a shout for me in the rebel land 
My hand did not conquer you as an arrogant one 
And therefore I did not bind you together with the hostile ones 
The guggazi and marhali stones 
The guggazi and marhali stones 
The guggazi and marhali stones 
The egizaga girinhiliba anzugulme and nirmuir stones 
The lord  
Ninurta the son of Enlil was decreeing its fate 
Whatever  you go whether formed as male and female you thus towards my place 
You possessed no sin your hand pushes that which is a wall demonstrating solidarity or inactivity as a conspirator 
As a witness you boasted about meyourself 
I will rear you inon my lap etc together with an adviser 
Like one who made the claim I am the general in the assembly 
nir stone you shall chose among the wine and syrup for me 
You pl shall faithfully care for gold which you are inlaid with 
Among the  of the gods 
The lands shall touch the nose in submission when you grovel 
My king attended to the flint he looked at it angrily 
At that time Erekigal slapped her thigh 
At that time Erekigal slapped her thigh 
At that time Erekigal slapped her thigh 
She bit her lip and considered the news 
She was speaking to Biti her chief gatekeeper 
Come Biti my chief gatekeeper 
Pay attention to what I have said to you 
She shall drag the bolts of the seven gates of the netherworld from their lock 
She shall push the single door of the palace of Ganzer push open 
The man took away her split apart skin 
What is going onis thishe doing 
Be satisfied Inanna This is the rite of the netherworld that is being completed 
Inanna This is the procedure of the netherworld you should not speak aloud 
When she bent downdied  her 
Her sister raised her up from her throne 
She sat down apart from her throne 
The seven judges of the Anuna were judging her 
Their decision was one of embittered anger 
 it was embittered anger 
 struck her and turned her into a smitten piece of meat 
The man hung her facefront from a crossbeam 
After seven years seven months and seven days elapsed 
Her vizier Ninubur paid attention to the word of her lady 
She repeatedly made the lament of ruin heaps for her 
She played the em drum of the assemblythrone room for her 
She circled the temples of the gods for her

They were saying give it whether it pertains to our king or our lady 
Linen does not spread over her holy knees

Erekigala  the lamentation singer and the kurgara priest 
Bring their lady  
Inanna brought from the netherworld by the orders of Enki 
When Inanna ascended from the netherworld Anuna seized her 
Saying Who is it that ascends from the netherworld who is brought up from the netherworld intact 
If Inanna is to be brought up from the netherworld 
she is to give an ablebodied replacement on her own head 
The one before her although he was not a vizier held a weapon 
The one before her although he was not a vizier held a weapon 
The one behind her although he was not a vizier  
The small galla demons as a ukur enclosure the large galla demons as a dubban fence held fast at her side 
The small galla demons as a ukur enclosure the large galla demons as a dubban fence held fast at her side 
They came for her 
They came for Inanna 
They were not consumers of heaped flour they were not drinkers of drawn water

They drove out  from her quarters 
They did not crush bitter garlic they were people who did not eat fish they were people who did not eat leeks

After Inanna came up from the netherworld Ninubur fell at her feet before her at the gate of Ganzer 
She sat in the dirt she wore a filthy garment

When she circled the temples of the gods she scratched her face for me she scratched her nose for me 
She scratched her ear a visible place for me she scratched a place unseen with a man her inner thigh for me 
To the Ekur the temple of Enlil to Urim and the temple of Nanna 
To Eridu and the temple of Enki she singularly set out

After you prepare my hands as those of a gazellesnake 
After you prepare my feet as those of a gazellesnake 
I shall escape my galla demon they shall not seize me 
Utu accepted his tears 
He prepared his hands as those of a gazellesnake

Holy Inanna gave Dumuzi the precedent maker as a replacement 
Holy Erekigal 
your praise is sweet 
Total one hundred seventy three lines 
The 3rd in a series of singlecolumn extracts in its entirety text with the incipit from great heaven towards great earth 
The junior galla demon opened his mouth and was speaking to the eldest galla demon 
Come let us go to the holy lap of Inanna 
The galla demons entered Unug and were seizing Inanna there 
Come Inanna Go  towards your path descend to the netherworld 
Go to the place you have plotted against descend to the netherworld 
Go to the place of Erekigal descend to the netherworld 
You should not wear the holy ba garment or the pala garment the garments of your queenship go to the netherworld 
After you remove the holy crown the ornament of glorification upon your head in order to descend to the netherworld 
You should not equipperfect your face with allure 
You should unfasten the small uridim dogs atfrom your feet descend to the netherworld

They released holy Inanna they  her 
Inanna herself handed over Dumuzi 
As for the youth we will put his feet in the great beam 
As for the youth we will cast the esad traprestraint upon him we will place neck in the neckstock 
The ubri spear kibir weapon and the great ukur spear were raised before him 
They were sharpening large hazin axes 
As for the male they were about to stand they were to sit 
We will cast a rope upon his shoulder position the executioner 
As for the youth they were to bind his arm and then tighten it up 
They were to cover his own face with his own garment 
The youth raised his hands heavenwards for Utu 
Utu I am your comrade like you I am a youth 
The one who married your sister 
She descends to the netherworld 
Because she descends to the netherworld 
I as a substitute am to be given to the netherworld 
Utu you are the judge of justice you are never to oppress anyone 
After you have altered my hands and changed my form 
I shall elude the hand of my pursuing galla demons they must not grasp me 
As a sagkal snake I shall traverse the meadows and the mountain range 
I shall take refuge with my sister Gtinanna 
Utu accepted his weeping 
He altered his hands and changed his form 
As a sagkal snake he traversed the meadows and the mountain range 
Dumuzi like a bird flying from the claws of a falcon guarded for his very life 
He took refuge with Getinanna 
getinanna saw her brother 
She scratched her cheeks she scratched her nose 
She unleashed a spearthorn in her side she split apart her garment 
She was intoning a lament of anathema for the youth afflicted by anathema 
Alas my brother alas my brother the days of the youth do not  
Alas my brother the shepherd Amauumgalana the days of the youth do not  
Alas my brother the youth who does not have a spouse who does not have a son 
Alas my brother the youth who does not have a comrade who does not have a friend 
Alas my brother the youth whose mother did not release her goodness 
The galla demons were seeking out Dumuzi they were roaming around 
The junior galla demons were speaking to the eldest demons 
They were galla demons without compassion who did not have a father mother spouse brother sister or son 
 removed from  the one set apart from the universe 
You are gala demons those who are to be reglected   
They did not have the power of goodness they did not know good and evil 
Who has seen someone with a healthy life without a home and all alone 
I will not go to where the friend is I will not go to where the inlaw is 
We shall go for the shepherd where getinanna is 
They were the galla demons who were to smite him by hand they were seeking him 
The lament was not yet finished in her mouth 
When the galla demons came to where getinanna was 
One of them was saying Show where your brother is but she was saying not a word to him 
He made her shave her own hair in her crotch but she was not saying a word to him 
He made her scratch her face with her own hands but she was not saying a word to him 
He made her own hands shred her garment but she was not saying a word to him 
He poured dirtsand in her crotch but she was not saying a word to him 
He did not find Dumuzi in the house of Getinanna 
The junior galla demons were speaking to the eldest demons 
Come let us go to the pure sheepfold 
Dumuzi  the sheepfold  they were castingducking down  
They were searching they were  
they were seeking he was seen 
Saying I shall take the ax to the youth like a dilapidated house 
They carved him with giriura knife they smote him in a silent place 
The sister roamed around in the city like a bird 
My brother who suffered this anathema Where shall I go I shall enter no ones house 
Lady who bears an aura amongst the furious me who rides the great me 
Inanna equipped with the  aankar weapon cloaking the battlefield with its bloodterror 
Who leans the shield upon the ground like one who runs amid the great battles 
Who clutches the storm and the stormwind 
For great lady Inanna counsel is dispensed in battle wise one 
Destroyer of the mountain she unleashed the arrow towards  by means of her power who smote with the arm in the mountain 
She screamed in the universe like a pirig creature and made the people tremble 
Like a great wild bull she stands wildly in the hostile land 
Like a furious pirig creature you extinguish  among the mightyclever and those disobedient to you in your bile 
My lady as you grow like heaven 
Young woman Inanna as you are supreme like the earth 
As you come out like Utu the king as you move widely about 
As you move inare suitable for heaven as you bear a furious aura 
As you carry the brilliant sunlight on the earth 
One who goes in the mountain range as you bring out a lapis net 
As you bathe in the pureflowering mountain 
As you fashion the uba mountain the mountain the pure place 
As your wear the udugita mace like the ancestral deities Enar and Enul 
As you make heads roll in its battles like you were using a  weapon 
The blackheaded shout this with song 
In all the lands the blackheaded sing this ilulama song sweetly 
The lady of battle the greateldest child of Suen 
Young woman Inanna I want to praise you 
Inanna said I am the lady when I go around heaven when I go around earth 
I am Inanna when I go around heaven when I go around earth 
When I go around the earth namely Elam and Subir 
When I go around the earth namely the land of lulubi 
When I am to thrash around in the inner mountain 
I am the lady I am the one that had approached the mountain it should notindeed it did act fearfully towards me 
I am Inanna I am the one that had approached the mountain it should notindeed it did act fearfully towards me 
I am the one that had approached the mountain range with the mountain of Ebih it should notindeed it did act fearfully towards me 
Like one who should notindeed did  towards me fromby means of its fear 
Like one who should notindeed did bring its nose near to the ground towards me 
Like one who should notindeed did drag its beard in the dust for me 
IbniSn was the scribe 
It is the month of NENEgar the 24th day 
The mountain should wish for my way 
In Ebih the mountain should praise me the mountain should extol me 
Inanna the child of Suen 
She was dressed in the pala garment she clad herself in pleasureallurestarsrosettes 
She adorned her forehead with a redfurious aura 
She arranged the red carnelian beads on her pure throat 
She acted youthfully with the sevenheaded udugita weapon at her right 
She set her foot on the staircase of lapis 
In the evening  brought out  
She set the door that is to be marveled at open in its path 
She established the nesag offerings for An and established the siskur ritesofferings for him 
An was one who rejoiced with Inanna 
He accepted the offerings and sat in his place 
Heshe filled the seat of honor of Anheaven 
An my father I make a case to you put your ear to my words 
An imposed my aurafear of me in the heavens 
It is you who has made my word have no rival in the universe 
In the outskirts of heaven there is a silig axe 
There is a sign and a mansium royal symbol 
To flatten the platform to make firm the thrones foundation 
To set in place the arm of weaponry to bend  like a mubum tree 
To yoke a team of six and hold the position 
To yoke a team of four and extend the reins 
To smite a caravan to go to the border in an expedition 
To appear for the king in the heaped earthsand of heaven like moonlight 
If you inspirelit establish an aura your idiocy 
If your dishonesty  
You do not approach the house 
You  
If your idiocy  you increaseIf my idiocy  is diminished 
One who is experiencing pleasure why am I not your opponent 
One who is experiencing pleasure why am I not your opponent 
One f who is peaceful why  
It is a fact that you are experiencing pleasure alas it is a fact that you should stand   
After you have relaxed  I shall arise  
Servile female worker of the district the pusher of the children of man

If he dropped his head in the tiny plants then no one can know his place 
Dumuzi They were seeking his head in the tiny plants no one found him 
If he dropped his head in the large plants then no one can know his place 
Dumuzi They were seeking his head in the large plants no one found him 
If he dropped his head in the dikes of Arali then no one can know his place 
Dumuzi They were catching him in the dikes of Arali 
Dumuzi wept and made sobbing noises 
My sister sustained me in the city my friend killed me in the city 
May my sister station her son in the street and may he be kissed 
May my friend station his son in the street and may he not be kissed 
They surrounded the man they  the reservoir 
They were braiding a cord for him they were knotting a net for him 
They were braiding the zippatum cord for him 
They were scratching sticks of manu wood for him 
The man before him was pelting him 
The man behind him was pulling him out from his hiding place as if he was merely one cubit tall 
His hands were seized in handcuffs 
his arms were bound in manacles 
The young man raised his hands heavenward for Utu 
Utu you are my brother in law I am your inlaw 
You are my food carrier to the Eanna temple 
I am the one who made a betrothal gift in Uruk 
I am the one who kissed the holy lips 
I am the one who played on the holy knees the knees of Inanna 
After you have prepared my hands as the hands of a gazelle 
After you have prepared my feet as the feet of a gazelle

Like a compassionate person he  mercy

The young man raised his hands heavenward for Utu 
Utu you are my brother in law I am your inlaw 
You are my food carrier to the Eanna temple 
I am the one who made a betrothal gift in Uruk 
He slipped away from the demons 
It was the house of the old woman Belili that he ran for his life towards 
Old woman I am not a human I am the spouse of a god 
After water is poured if only water could be drunk 
After flour is poured if only water could be drunk 
After water was poured after flour was poured she sat him down there 
The old woman left the house 
when the old woman left 
The galla demons saw her 
If the old woman does not know where Dumuzi dwells 
What makes her look around with a frightened gaze 
What makes her shout with a frightened voice 
Come We will go to the house of old woman Belili

He was speaking to his servant Enkidu 
Enkidu the shoulder of a young man has not brought out the limitssecrets of living

Where a name can stand be inscribed I want to establish my name 
Where a name cannot stand be inscribed I want to establish the name of the gods 
His servant Enkidu was replying

Gilgamesh took a white goat kid 
He clasped a brown goat kid of the madaria delivery to his chest 
His hand held the pure scepter at his nose 
He was calling out to Utu of heaven 
Utu if I am to enter into the mountain will you be my helper 
If I am to enter into the mountain of cut juniper will you be my helper 
Utu from heaven was replying to him 
You are of yourself a young man a native son what are you to the mountain 
Utu I want to speak to you may your ear be oriented towards my words 
I shall greet you may my words be listened to 
In my city a man dies and I am distressed 
One has forgotten a man and my heart is pained 
On the city wall I stretched out my neck 
I saw a corpse floated by the river in the water 
But I should not be done thusly Thus I must be 
A tall man has never stretched to heaven 
A broad man has never engulfed the land 
I want to enter into the mountain I want to establish my name 
The 5th is  a screaming sagkal snake  splitting the mountain range 
The 6th is  beating its breast against the mountain like a flood 
The 7th is  flashing like lightning no one will approach its side 
The seven heroes the youth Utu gave to Gilgamesh 
They will bring the boats for portage to the base of the mountain range 
It was made pleasing there for the one who cuts the juniper 
It was made pleasing there for lord Gilgamesh 
In his city as a single man he sounded the horn 
As two companions he and Enkidu they shouted together 
The one who has a household to his household the one who has lives with a mother to his mother 
May single males acting like me act on behalf of my power 
The one who has a household to his household the one who has lives with a mother to his mother

The hero sat down wept and made sobbing noises

Was attacking in a pack like wolves 
For Enki the water of the stern 
Was slaughtering like a lion 
At that time there was a single tree a halub tree 
The one that was planted on the bank of the Euphrates 
The one that was to drink water from the Euphrates 
The power of the southern wind tore it out at its roots it ripped it out its branches 
The Euphrates struck it with floodwater 
The woman who was fearing the command of An was coming by 
Fearing the command of Enlil was coming by 
She grasped the tree in her hand and brought it to Uruk 
She was bringing it towards the flowering orchard of Inanna 
The woman did not plant the tree as it was in her hand it was by means of her foot that she planted it 
The woman did not water the tree as it was in her hand it was by means of her foot that she watered it 
She said When am I to sit on its flowering throne 
She said When am I to I lie down on its flowering bed 
The wood thickened but its bark could not be split 
At its base a snake that was immune to incantations made a nest 
In its branches the Anzu bird placed its chick 
The demon maiden of the empty wind made a house in its middle 
The laughing rejoicing young woman 
Holy Inanna how she was weeping 
The day was about to break the horizon was about to light up 
The little birds at daybreak were about to shriek 
When Utu came out from his chamber 
His sister to the hero Utu 
Holy Inanna was speaking 
My brother long ago when fate was decreed 
When days of abundance elapsed in the land 
When An had brought away the sky 
When Enlil had brought away the earth 
When  gifted that of the netherworld on behalf of ErekigalWhen that of the netherworld was gifted on behalf of Erekigal 
When he rode when he rode 
When the father rode towards the netherworld 
When Enki rode towards the netherworld 
For the lord  cast down the small stones 
For Enki  cast down the large stones 
The little ones were hammerstoneshandsized stones 
Month of NENEgar 26th day 
The ibbaru harness there was fifty mina within it  on his hips 
He tied on the fifty mina 
of his hazin axe the weapon of his campaign 
which weighed 7 talents and 7 mina he took hold 
At the base of the halub tree he smote the snake that was immune to incantations 
In its branches the Anzu bird took its chick and dragged it away to the mountain range 
The demon maidens of the empty wind who had built a house in its middle
fled to the wasteland 
He struck the tree at its trunk and cut its branches 
The citizens of his city who had come to him 
made it submitgathered the branches 
They gave it to his sister holy Inanna as her throne 
They gave it to her as her bed 
He took the base of the tree for his ballHow the base of the tree was taken for his ball 
He took the branches of the tree for his mallet 
The one who always played ball brings out the ball in the smoothed street 
The one who always boasted about himself brings out the ball in the smoothed street the young men of his city who always played ball 
Because of him the one by whom the force of widows children was ridden 
They lamented with the phrase oh my neck oh my hips 
Those who had a mother she was bringing food for her son 
Those who had a sister she was pouring water for her brother 
Away fromby means of the accusation of the widows 
And the cries to Utu of the young maidens 
He dropped his ball and my mallet into the bottom of the netherworld 
He brought his hand up to it and could not touch it 
He brought his foot up to it and could not touch it

The mother of the king pure Nininsina 
To her beloved son Damu the great physician of Enlil said
Great physician you know the plant of life you know the potion  of life
Great physician holding the cloth  of life 
Your cloth  being the plant of life 
Your cloth  being white linen your destiny 
Before Utu who loves to sustain people 
The mother speaking a lament for the sick wailing
Those who are sick  diseases  
The sister who is proud  among the young men you cannot take away 
Offspring and little ones  who listens to laments 
When he submits the troopshe binds 
To scatter their cities one by one Utu the judge  and pure An ordered 
My young man who has respect of the gods who drinks  the potion of life 
Noble Sueniddinam who has respect of the gods who drinks  the potion of life 
A prayer of life I

An your lofty command takes precedence who would say No to you 
Father of the gods your word the foundation of heaven and earth no god fails to heed it  
Lord you are the leader who takes only his own counsel what should be our counsel 
Grant your strength to the maiden Itar whom you have loved   
Your reliable approval weighty as heaven make known to her in our assembly  
Give to the mistress whom you have loved your combined divine powers   
Let Kiar truly be the spouse equal with you may she rise to the equivalent authority of your name  
Moreover in addition let her carry out herself the decrees of Enlil and Enki    
When she alone has taken hold of the noserope of heaven and earth she shall be our strength 
For An the pleasant conversation produced happiness
He in his goodness of heart treated holy Inanna well   
The commands of my Anuship are the complex fundament of heaven which cannot be equaled

At the eternal foundation of heaven and earth and by the enduring designs of the gods  
when in the beginning Anu Enlil and Ea allotted the shares 
for the two gods the watchmen of heaven and netherworld the ones who open the door of Anu
for moongod and sungod the night and day were made in equal parts 
and from the bottom of heaven to the top of heaven they assign them their tasks 
to keep all the stars of heaven on course as in a furrow 
to make the leading gods keep to their paths like oxen 
Up into that place Inanna rise to the rulership of them all 
Lady you be the brightest of them so may they call you Itar of the Stars  
May your high position relative to them alternate between the two sides east and west triumphantly
May your splendor be as abundant as that of the moon and sun in their watches 
May the flaring glow of your torch shine high in the sky  
May the people marvel at you as one for whom among the gods there is none to check up on her
After the lord had bestowed these great powers upon the daughter of Sn 
he did not keep her away from the shrine Eanna her sacred chamber
After king Anu had bestowed the great powers upon her 
they presented to her the shrine Eanna her sacred chamber 
He covered her figure with the ceremonial garment of Anuhood the brilliant splendor of Sn
He made her appear like the day with superb ornaments the ornaments of divinity 
He enhanced her arm with the scepter of kingship the fierce wood staff the unsparing weapon   
A glorious crown which is like that on the head of Nanna he set firmly upon her head  
O Hierodule my important decisions divine powers which could not be asked for by anyone else I have assigned to you 
Like me may Enlil king of all the lands treat you well  
Because of this Lord Nunamnira became happy his liver surged with joy

Inanna after you have made fighting and battle flip about like a skiprope 
O lady of battle make them clash together like a ball and driving stick 
Goddess of contention make battle be pursued like puppetsdolls being manipulated 
Lady at the place of clashing of weapons strike with chaos like the banging down of astragals 
Inanna when like an overwhelming storm you are consolidating the contingents of battle 
when you demonstrate your great ability with the divine mace the doubleheaded ax the big sword and arrows  
when you put on the fierce armor let the deluge rage 
When you make ready your bowthrowstick and shield of battle may the storms whirl about for you 
May your raging divine weapon strike the evil person with lightning like the plague god Erra 
Lady at the place of clashing of weapons and planting of standards no one can get away from the opening of your arms 
My daughter wherever it is pleasing to you to extend upwards to extend downwards to pull taut or to loosen 
Having no limits at the place where destinies are decided your pronouncements are indeed as great as my pronouncements 
At festivals offerings banquets prostration making obeisance and invoking the name of the god 
a human being whose god has gotten very angry with him whose goddess has become souredjealous towards him 
as long as he does not seek out the place of reconciliation with your divinity no god will be agreeable to his petition 
At my city the mountain of Sumer and Akkad the shade of the world quarters

After bringing down  like

I shall make him die amid dripping blood  
May my battleaxe forever hit its teeth like a bittertoothed dog

Against their men on the pis walls

may barbararrows like flying bats 
continually fly for me into the mouth of battle 
ma slingstones rain down on their people 
may thick clay balls like handstones 
clatter on their backs 
The separated peoples of the insurgent region

May my  bite the heads of the Land 
May my battleaxe cross over the blood of the people like water 
May my doubleedged axe weapon

Whoever stood with me I shall let stand on his feet 
whoever did not stand with me I shall grind up on the spot 
The young ones of the foreign lands I shall let ride off on ships

To those who did not return and spread out the days will not be long 
I the king shall avenge my city 
Whatever was destroyed in Sumer in the foreign lands I shall destroy 
The gods of their cities I shall cause to get into shoes

In their fertile fields of shining barley I shall let long grass grow

In their wellorchards where date syrup and fig trees grew I shall make weeds grow

ulgi roaring like a rising flood against the insurgent region 
his brother and friend lord Gilgame 
his aide like one born  embraced 
together with ulgi the right shepherd of Sumer he walked along the path 
The king of the silver heavens spreading out a wide crown 
the lord the bright sun of the gods 
Father Nanna by him on his right side  
together with ulgi the right shepherd of Sumer he walked along the path 
Born to a great wild bull a lion standing in his strength

When he arrived at Enegir 
the fierce snake gnashing  
the lord of  
Ninazu  
together with ulgi the right shepherd of Sumer he walked along the path 
At the same time from the abzu emerged 
King Enki lifted one eye out of the abzu 
from where he stands destroying for him the foreign lands 
from where he sits destroying for him the cities 
He of rightful speech whose utterances are firmly established 
Nudimmud great lord of Eridu 
together with ulgi the right shepherd of Sumer he walked along the path 
When he arrived at the Ebabbar the house of Utu 
the king who loves justice  clad in linen 
The young ones of the foreign lands he let ride off on ships 
the big ones he sent back from old age 
To those who did not return and spread out the days were not long 
The hero avenged his city 
Whatever was destroyed in Sumer in the foreign lands he destroyed 
The gods of their cities he caused to get into shoes 
their prettyface udug and lamma protective deities he let step out 
In their fertile fields of shining barley he let long grass grow 
their thick and tall trees with the axe he brought to destruction 
their trees of wealth he crossed over at the crown 
their small trees he uprooted 
In their wellorchards where date syrup and fig trees grew he made weeds grow 
 plants and  herbs continually break through the earth 
After the king had destroyed the cities and laid flat the city walls 
with floodwater had caused the torched foreign lands to shake 
the seed of the Guti like seedgrain had scattered 
his heart had  
then the silver and lapis lazuli of the foreign lands into leather pouches he put 
All their treasures he gathered together 
and all the goods of the foreign lands counted to one load 
On their delivered cattle and delivered sheep 
the name of Enlil invoking 
the name of Ninlil invoking 
The hero after achieving an august revenge in the foreign lands 
had his blue barge of royalty caulked 
adorned with expansive silver horns its ram of gold gleaming in the middle of heaven 
Its bitumen  bitumen of Enki 
was caressed from the abzu 
its cabin was a palace carrying a terrible splendor on August River 
like the sky with stars it was decorated 
Its silver  
The king  
The king  
ulgi the right shepherd of Sumer  his feet upon  
his seat on a throne of  he took 
The sim and ala drums resounded for him 
and the balaghouse drums played music for him 
My king  you have destroyed the foreign lands and plundered their cities  
like a wild bull  the hills  
the cantors for him were signing in a song 
His tireless boatmen 
hoisting and hanging sail 
thesesons of Enegir and sons of Ur 
with the lord their  oars hung out 
At the temples of Nippur the temples Duranki 
at the Kargetina of Enlil 
did he not moor the boat 
With the silver and lapis lazuli of the foreign lands put into leather pouches 
all their treasures gathered together 
with all the goods of the foreign lands counted to one load 
he enters before Enlil 
 the king  
a destiny for ulgi he decrees 
King a destiny for you I shall decree a good destiny for you I shall decree 
ulgi a destiny for you I shall decree a good destiny for you I shall decree 
heroism as your destiny I shall decree 
Longlasting lordship and kingship as your destiny I shall decree 
In terrifying splendor may you lean your neck 
Before your fierce face may no one stand 
May your crown of royalty shine radiantly 
May your sceptre be a thing of princes 
and may its shining branches provide you with shade 
May there be joy in your stomach and may you never grow weary 
May you be a breathoflife king in your assembly 
May your life flourish like herbs may it flourish like grain 
May it flourish like a right mes tree in a broad plot 
For Ningirsu 
For Ningirsu 
the mighty warrior 
of Enlil 
Gudea 
ruler  
of Laga 
made a fitting thing resplendent for him namely  
his EninnuWiththeWhiteThunderbird 
he built  
and restored for him 
At the king sailing 
to Uruk towards the princely divine powers 
Sumer and Akkad marvel 
Did he not he moor the boat at the quay of Kulaba 
With a big wild bull of the mountains with uplifted horns 
with a sheep led by the hand of an en priest at his right side 
with a reddish kid and a bearded kid doubled up on the breast 
before Inanna in the shrine of Eanna he enters 
Good shepherd ulgi loving heart dressed himself in a ma garment 
put a ili wig as a crown on his head 
Inanna marveled 
and spontaneously struck up a song 
singing the lyrics 
When for the king for the lord 
I have bathed 
when for the shepherd Dumuzi I have bathed 
when I have adorned my sides with clay 
when with resin I have colored my nose 
when with kohl I have covered my face 
when with hands of his fairness 
he has covered my hips 
when the lord who lies down beside silver Inanna 
the shepherd Dumuzi 
has said I would loosen that of the lap 
when in my radiant arms he has grown calm 
when  like choice beer 
 had touched 
when my lapwool has  
my pawool he has played 
when he has put hand to my vulva 
when on my sweet stomach he has lain 
like his night boat  
like his thin boat he has finished 
when on the bed he has caressed me 
then the lord I shall caress 
I shall decree him a good destiny 
the good shepherd ulgi I shall caress 
decree him a good destiny 
his thick arms I shall caress 
shepherdship of all lands 
as his destiny I shall decree 
The lady the mountaincrystal of heaven 
delight of the blackheaded 
youthful woman who excels her mother 
by her father granted divine powers 
Inanna daughter of Suen 
for ulgi son of Ninsun 
decrees a destiny 
Your walking to the fore in battle am I 
Your weapon carrier in combat like an attendant am I 
Your advocate in the assembly am I 
Your breathgiver in the campaign am I 
Shepherd chosen by  silver are you 
King good provider of Eanna are you 
carneol of Ans Irigal are you 
fir for running 
fit to lift head in the august dais are you 
fit to take a seat on the lapis throne 
your head fit to wear a colorful 
as to your body fit to spread out a the fleecegarment 
fit for stomachhanging of the garment of royalty 
fit to lift to the side the mitumweapon 
fit to open knees with mace 
fit to send off straight the broad arrows 
fit for throwing stick and shield bound to the hips 
as to your hands fit for silver staff 
as to your feet fit for silver sandals 
You have knees On the campaign fit for running 
fit for playing like a calf of lapis on my silver breast 
May your loving stomach be lasting 
An has doned this for you may he never alter it 
May Enlil the decreer of fates never change it 
So did Inanna caress him 
He who knows the joyful heart of Ninegal 
sheared a black kid 
bathed a white kid 
wild bulls of the mountains by their noses tied up 
house of the august breeding bull roars 
up to the young man Utu into the temple Ebabbar brings 
up to the young man Utu raising his radiant forehead 
For ulgi good shepherd of Sumer he decress a fate 
King colorful words sweet face 
mighty hero born to be a lion 
young cow standing firm in its vigor 
valiant unbound in his strength 
whose feet trample great mountains 
the heroes of the foreign lands you have brought down 
you have trampled upon all the thrones 
your name to the edge of heaven you have established 
Your kingto Aimbabbar go in peace 
And so at Enegir city built in splendor 
did he not moor the boat 
Seed placed by the prince in the silver womb born on the bright mountain 
Ninazu like a wild bull lowing in drink 
 like date syrup ghee  
 like date syrup ghee  
 like date syrup ghee  
 like date syrup ghee  
your are hero Come down from the revolting lands  
King the lord of prayers and supplications chooses you by heart 
shepherd ulgi the lord of prayers and supplications chooses you by heart 
Who sets a king given strength by Enlil 
Who enters to your  
Who exits to your  
 who knows your stomach should not desire your strength 
Having desired  battle with you 
what escapes your outstretched arms 
When like the thunder bird you shriek who stands before you 
When like the storm you howl 
the foreign lands open reeds ablaze mountains trembling like reeds 
in the houses of the foreign lands watching 
Tidnum well marveled 
Like Utu your terror radiates in battle 
Like Nergal your mace drools in death 
your lance reaches into the blood of the Land 
The great door of the city are you the great wall of the Land are you 
A net piled up over heaven and earth are you leadjenny positioned with Sumer are you 
May your  call in abundance 
May the words of Enlil enormous things create shade on your head 
May the loving heart Inanna never abandon you 
After Ninazu had called  blessings again and again 
he let ewes goodly produce endless lambs 
let jennies goodly produce endless kids 
let white cows set up calves 
then before Nanna in his Etemenniguru he enters with them 
head held high in the most fitting house of the the royal household in its royal offering place the silver place 
His king Aimbabbar casts a joyous glance at him 
for ulgi the good shepherd of Sumer decreed a fate 
Hero lord mighty one of the foreign lands right arm of the Land 
you have achieved victory for me have carried out the commandeds 
The houses of the rebel lands that I have cursed you have reduced to ruin mounds 
May you never grow weary of perfecting the divine powers for me every month at new moon 
Like Anan may your name be as sweet in the mouth of the Land and in the mouths of all the countries 
May silver Ningal lady of the Enunna like the wooden frame of a waterskin spread out her lap for you 
Thus did Suen decree a good fate 
In the Egalma of Ninegal he took his seat on the silver throne 
The Itaran of Sumer omniscient from the womb 
renders the judgments of the Land in due order 
makes decisions for the Land in due order 
lets no strong man wrong the weak 
lets mother speak sweetly to her child 
lets child answer truthfully to his father 
Sumer is filled with abundance 
Ur prolonged in splendor 
 establishes 
Because the king exulted in his triumph and let his might radiate 
his heroism set well 
made the rebellious lands bow 
made our city Ur raise neck in prosperity 
king adorned with a face of colorful lapis son of Enlil 
lifting up head to heaven in broad crown 
with An in his lofty place taking counsel sitting with Ura on a big throne 
manth and passing days making the Land of Sumer and all the foreign lands play joyously

A man who a command of evildoing
does not issue regarding this

who does not erase my inscription
and does not write his name upon it
may a life of long existence
be granted to him
May he lift his neck up high in the Ekur
and may the shining brow of Enlil
turn down from heaven
But a person who issues an order of evildoing

Yadiiil 
son of Zankanax
It was time to decide destinies in heaven and on earth 
Lagash had raised the head towards heaven in large me 
Enlil looked righteously upon lord Ningirsu 
Did the nig2ul not emerge in our city 
The heart did it not return to its banks 
The heart of Enlil did it not return to its banks 
The heart did it not return to its banks 
The flood did it not twinkle Frightening all 
The heart of Enlil it is the river Tigris did it not bring sweet water 
To the house its king spoke 
I will make the me of Eninnu emerge in heaven and on earth 
The governor is wise he shall pay attention 
He shall enlarge big things 
He shall straighten the horns of perfect oxen perfect goats 
The brick of deciding destinies lifted the head towards him 
to build the shiny house it raised its neck towards him 
It was then in a dark goat that towards his king 
on the lord Ningirsu Gudea looked 
Build his house he ordered him 
On Eninnu whose me is very large 
he Ningirsu directed his Gudeas eye there 
Gudea his heart is distant 
counseled about the message 
Let me let me tell it to her let me let me tell it to her

Lions lay by his right and left

His heart I did not understand 
A light went up on the horizon for me 
There was one woman Who was it who was it not

She held a stylus of purified silver in the hand 
She had the tablet of the stars on her lap 
She counseled it 
Secondly it was a hero

In a just poplar standing in front of me 
a tibubird passed the time tweeting 
A donkey stallion on the right side of my king scratched the earth for me

About his brick placed in the mold

and their names in the midst of the gods

made them emerge 
The cedar doors standing in the house

Ke and Aratta give instructions at the tying together of the house

gazing at the land 
the lonely wanderer cannot pass 
The fear of Eninnu on all the lands

The house founded by Anu with purified silver 
decorated with good perfume 
rising in heavenly brilliance like the moon 
The face of the house is a large mountain leaning on earth

Its king Lord Ningirsu 
chose it in his shiny heart 
he poured it on top like good incense 
Gudea in the brilliance of heaven 
decorated it 
From the cow pen 
oil deliveries milk deliveries 
From the mighty oven 
large cakes large croissants 
The Girpana 
feeding oxen feeding sheep 
The provisions place sustaining the uzga 
The winecellar 
called mountain dripping with wine 
From the brewery 
called Tigris is being water in its might 
In the treasury precious stones silver tin 
The coach house 
called mountain standing on the ground 
The inner room of haprs called ox roaring princely 
The courtyard shiny prayers sim and ala sounds 
The stone basin sleeping in the house

The tin basin siding with the storeroom 
it is the light lifting the distant gaze to the mountain 
The garden of the black plain placed with the house

The seven stones seized by the house 
are things counselling with its king 
The house of funerary offerings

green mountain range standing to be admired
standing out above all the lands
The House being a great mountain bordered on heaven
being the sun it filled midheaven with light
being Eninnu the White Thunderbird
it attacked the mountain with spread wings
The people have all been settled again and the Land has gone home
but the Anunna gods are all standing in admiration
The ruler who is wise is knowledgeable
kisses the ground over and over before the divinities
with rites and prayer in submission he touches the ground
the ruler the personal god of his city says a prayer
For the breadconsuming House he added more bread
for the supper in need of mutton he added more sheep
As if it were for the abundance of vast midheaven
in front of the House he set up jars in a row
He went to the Anunna gods
prayed to them O all you Anunna gods who are admiring what the Land of Laga achieved
protectors of all the countries whose command a torrent of water
will make the one who would try to stem it founder
but who to the worthy man upon whom they looked
have given a long life
I the shepherd built the House and my master will enter his House
would you O Anunna gods say a blessing on my behalf

stick out the tongue
all of them arms of battle that have been endued with the power of kingship
with all this the ruler who had built the House
Gudea ruler
of Laga
is presenting the House
Along with copper tin slabs of lapis lazuli shining metal and spotless Melua carnelian
huge copper pails huge copper urivessels
shining copper edavessels shining copper bowls befitting An

so that a properly set table  altar
might be piled up to An

Gudea before the lord Ningirsu
did come
The House lifted the head proud of itself
unparalleled in awe and splendor
Like a boat it 
Its owner on the dais of Girnun
Its owner on the dais of Girnun
the warrior Ningirsu came out like daylight
The canopy of the dais resting on a support
is like the beautiful sky carrying splendour
The poles of the canopy and their caps
are Ningirsu himself laden with terror
The leather cord of the canopy fitted in front of it
is like a snake with a yellow mouth bathing in water
In his most fascinating blue chariot
The owner of the House the warrior Ningirsu stands like the sun god
The throne of the House standing in the guenna
is the bright seat of An dwelling in  
The bed of the House standing in the bedroom
is adorned with young cows that kneel down at their shed

mother Baba with the lord Ningirsu
is lying at ease

are cooking in shining bronze vessels

are like huge stout troughs with an inexhaustible supply of water
and the goblets standing next to them
are both the Tigris and the Euphrates
bringing abundance
Thus he had caused everything to function as it should in his city
Gudea had built the Eninnu
had met with all cultic necessities

When his master had entered his House
for seven days
the slave woman was allowed to be equal to her mistress
the slave was allowed to walk side by side with his master
In his city the one who appeared unclean to someone was permitted to sleep only outside
he had words cut off the evilspeaking tongue
and he had anything disharmonious turned away from the House
To the justice ordained by Nane and Ningirsu
he paid attention
he did not expose the orphan to the wealthy person
nor did he expose the widow to the influential one
In a house having no male child
a daughter of it would become its heir
Days of justice had risen for him
and he set his foot on the neck of evil and complaint
For his city like the sun god
had he himself not risen from the horizon
He 
In the face of bright heaven
he showed who he was
Like a bull he enters his head raised high
In the Eninnu sanctuary
he had unblemished oxen and kids slaughtered
He put a jar in the open
and poured much wine into it
The harp DragonoftheLand he joined with the kettle drum
and the ala instruments sounded for him like a storm
Lo the ruler on a 
stood
and his city gave him acclaim
Gudea 
 brought forth abundance for him
All places grew speckled barley for him
Laga under its ruler made abundance
increase for him
Now that the warrior had moved into his new House
Gudea served a delicious banquet to the lord Ningirsu
He seated An at the place of honour for him
he made Enlil sit next to An
and next to Enlil
he seated Ninma
The owner rejoiced over the House
The owner rejoiced over the House
and he made a firm promise for the brick of Eninnu
O brick of Eninnu
let something favorable be promised
brick of Eninnu let it be promised
let something favorable be promised
House a mountain founded in heaven
built as your very self
He determines the destiny of the brickwork of the Eninnu
he determines the brickworks destiny
he determines a good destiny for the brickwork of the Eninnu
The temple that lets fear fall like embers set upon the earth and embracing heaven
 holy 
 Let the cattle pens be built on your behalf
 Let the cattle pens be built on your behalf
let the sheepfolds be renewed on your account
May the people lie down in safe pastures under your reign enjoying abundance
and let the eyes of all the countries be directed toward Sumer
May the House your Thunderbird soar in the skies for your benefit
grown as tall as Gilgamesh
grown as tall as Gilgamesh
grown as tall as Gilgamesh
grown as tall as Gilgamesh
its throne set there no one shall remove
Your personal god is Ningezida grandson of An
your mother goddess is Ninsuna the mother who bore healthy offspring
and who loves her offspring

whose awe and aura are shed over the Land
now that An that Enlil have made a firm promise for Laga
that about Ningirsus reputation
all countries have learned
that Eninnu is joined both to heaven and earth
praise be unto Ningirsu
Of the composition Ningirsus House having been built
this is the end of the praising hymn
Gudea 
ruler 
of Lagash 
the man by whom the Eninnu 
of Ningirsu 
was built 
For Ninhursaga 
the lady who grew up with the city 
the mother of all children 
his lady 
Gudea 
ruler 
of Lagash 
her temple of the city Girsu 
he built for her 
Her sacred treasure chest 
he constructed for her 
Her great throne of queenship 
he constructed for her 
and into her Great Temple he had it brought to her 
From the mountains of Magan 
he had diorite brought down 
and into this his stone figure 
he formed it 
The lady who would determine the fates in heaven and earth 
Nintu 
the mother of the gods 
of Gudea 
the man who built the temple 
his life she shall prolong 
he named it for her 
and into the temple he had it brought to her 
Within the temple of Ningirsu 
his master
for the statue of Gudea 
the ruler 
of Lagash 
the man by whom the Eninnu temple 
was built 
one sila3 of beer 
one sila3 of bread 
one half sila3 of heapingflour 
and one half sila3 of emmer groats 
being the regular offering existing for it 
a future ruler 
who shall revoke it 
and who the divine power of Ningirsu 
shall thereby diminish 
may his regular offerings 
within the temple of Ningirsu 
be revoked 
and all his pronouncements be blocked 
For Ningirsu 
strong hero 
of Enlil 
Gudea 
he of lasting fame 
ruler 
of Lagash 
the shepherd chosen by the heart 
of Ningirsu 
regarded favorably 
by Nane

he sent out of the city 
Women did not carry the earth baskets for it 
only the chief warriors did the building for him 
The temple of Ningirsu 
like the city Eridu 
in a clean place he built 
There was no beating with whips 
nor beating with leather straps 
No mother hit her child with anything 
The military governors 
overseers 
foremen 
those who performed worker levies 
while stationed at the work 
as light as wool under the carding comb 
was the disciplining he put into their hands 
No pickax was used in the cemetery of the city 
no corpse was buried 
The lamentation singer did not play the harp or bring forth laments 
The wailing women did not perform wailing 
Within the territory 
of Lagash 
a person having a lawsuit 
to the place of oathtaking 
did not make another person go 
and a creditor 
did not enter another persons house 
For Ningirsu 
his master 
he Gudea made a fitting thing come forth resplendently 
namely his temple Eninnu with a white thunderbird

opened up the roads for him 
From the Amanus the mountain range of cedar

be brought down 
From the mountain range of Barme 
many stones 
into big boats 
he loaded 
and he placed them around the base of the Eninnu 
The cities of Anan and Elam with weapons 
he smote 
and the booty from them 
to Ningirsu 
into the Eninnu 
he had brought in 
Gudea 
the ruler 
of Lagash 
when the Eninnu 
he had built for Ningirsu 
he made it as a lasting treasure 
A temple fashioned like this 
not a single ruler 
for Ningirsu 
had ever built 
But he Gudea did indeed build it 
He inscribed his name 
and made this fitting thing come forth resplendently 
To the commands 
of Ningirsu 
he set forth a faithful hand 
From the land of Magan 
he brought down diorite 
and into this stone figure 
he formed it 
For my master 
his temple 
I built 
so life is my reward 
was how he named it for him 
and into the Eninnu 
he had it brought to him 
Gudea 
to the statue 
gives these words 
Statue to my master 
do say thus 
When the Eninnu 
his beloved temple 
I built for him 
I had debts remitted and I washed all hands 
For seven days no barley was ground 
The slave woman was made equal with her mistress 
and by the slave 
his master stood side by side 
In my city the sexually impure with respect to him Ningirsu 
I made to go out to sleep at the edge of it 
Evil to its house 
I made go back 
To the laws 
of Nane 
and Ningirsu 
I attended 
An orphan I did not let be put under the control of a rich person 
and a widow I did not let be put under the control of a powerful person 
For an estate not having a son 
a daughter of it its heir 
I made become 
The stone statue 
he made receptive to messages 
This statue 
is neither of silver nor is it of lapis lazuli 
It is neither of copper nor of tin 
nor is it of bronze 
No one must put it to any other use 
and so it is made only of diorite 
Let it stand at the place of libations 
By an act of force 
let no one destroy it 
O statue before you 
is standing a statue of Ningirsu 
The statue 
of Gudea 
the ruler 
of Lagash 
the man by whom the Eninnu 
of Ningirsu 
was built
any person who from the Eninnu 
shall remove it 
or its inscription 
shall erase from it 
or any person who shall destroy it 
at the beginning of a good year 
a future person whom as did my god 
his own god 
Ningirsu 
my master 
has called to from among all the people 
who then my judgments 
shall overturn 
my gifts 
would revoke 
and from my collected songs 
having displaced my name 
shall set his own name on them 
who in the courtyard of Ningirsu my master 
shall abandon its established shrines 
without having kept before his eyes 
that since days of old 
since the seed first emerged 
when a ruler 
of Lagash 
the Eninnu 
for Ningirsu 
my master 
had built
being a person who had made a fitting thing come forth resplendently
his words 
no one shall ever alter 
nor ever overturn his judgments 
Therefore regarding Gudea 
the ruler 
of Lagash 
anyone who shall alter his word 
or shall overturn his judgments 
may An

and my personal god Ningezida 
may they all change his fate 
Like an ox 
may he be slaughtered in his noonday prime 
Like an aurochs 
may he be seized by his fierce horns 
May his throne which people had set up for him 
be made to sit out in the dust 
If 
to erasing this inscription 
he should set his mind 
let his own name in the house of his god 
from the tablets be removed 
May his own god 
not look upon the settled people 
May he hold back the rain in the sky 
and hold back the waters upon the earth 
May years of dearth stretch out for him 
and may there be famine during his reign 
That person 
like a man who does evil to a righteous person 
may that ones end produce a shutting in heaven 
and may it not be released 
Of the most forceful of all the gods 
of lord Ningirsu 
may his greatness 
be known by the nation

A person who from the Eanna

or who shall destroy it 
or erase its inscription 
Inana

Envoys of Aga the son of Enmebaragesi 
from Kish to Gilgamesh in Uruk came 
Gilgamesh before the elders of his city 
presented the issue carefully choosing his words 
There are wells to be finished wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed 
To the house of Kish We should not submit Should we not smite it with weapons 
In the convened assembly the elders of his city 
answer Gilgamesh 
There are indeed wells to be finished wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed 
So we should submit to the house of Kish We should not smite it with weapons 
Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba 
in Inanna placing his trust 
the advice of the elders of his city did not take seriously 
a second time Gilgamesh before the ablebodied men of his city 
presented the issue carefully choosing his words 
There are wells to be finished wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed 
Never before have you submitted to the house of Kish Should you not smite it with weapons 
In the convened assembly the ablebodied men of his city answer Gilgamesh 
Standing on duty and sitting in attendance 
the son of the king escorting 
the reins of the donkey always grasping 
who has the breath as the saying goes 
To the house of Kish you all should not submit With weapons should we not smite it 
The structure of Uruk the handiwork of the gods 
and of Eanna the house from heaven lowered down 
the great gods created 
The great wall the wall which An founded 
the majestic residence which An established 
you watch over You are its king and warrior 
an exuberant person a prince by An beloved 
When Aga comes what terror he will experience 
That army is small at the rear scattered 
Its men will be incapable of confronting us 
Then Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba 
at the advice of the ablebodied men of his city rejoiced and his spirit brightened 
His servant Enkidu he addressed 
On this account let the weaponry and arms of battle be made ready 
Let the battle mace to your side return 
A great terror and radiance may they create 
When he comes my great fearsomeness will overwhelm him 
His reasoning will become confused his judgment disarrayed 
Not 5 days not 1 days had passed 
when Aga the son of Enmebaragesi to Uruk with his men laid siege  
Uruks reasoning became confused 
Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba 
to its warriors speaks 
My warriors shall have the choice 
Let someone with courage rise up I shall go against Aga 
Birurtura his royal guard 
in admiration to his king says 
I shall go against Aga 
so that his reasoning will become confused his judgment disarrayed 
Birurtura through the city gate went out 
As soon as Birurtura went out through the city gate 
at the gate of the city gate they captured him 
Birurturas entire length beating 
Into the presence of Aga he came 
speaking to Aga 
His words were not done a mirrorholder of Uruk on the wall climbing up 
out over the wall leaned 
Aga trained his eyes 
to Birurtura speaking 
Slave is that man your king 
That man is not my king 
Were that man my king 
were that his angry brow 
were those his bison eyes 
were that his lapis lazuli beard 
were those his elegant fingers 
would he not cast down multitudes Would he not raise up multitudes 
Would multitudes not be smeared with dust 
Would not all the nations be overwhelmed 
Would not the canalmouths of the land be filled with silt 
Would not the horns of the barges be broken 
Would he not take captive Aga the king of Kish in the midst of his army 
Hitting him striking him 
Birurturas entire length they were beating 
After the mirrorholder of Uruk Gilgamesh climbs up on the wall 
the young and old of Kulaba his radiance overwhelms 
The ablebodied men of Uruk with battle maces he armed 
on the causeway at the door of the city gate stationed 
Enkidu through the city gate alone went out 
Gilgamesh out over the wall leaned 
Looking up Aga opened his eyes 
Slave is that man your king 
That man is indeed my king 
It was just as he had said 
Multitudes fell multitudes rose up 
multitudes with dust were smeared 
all the nations were overwhelmed 
the canalmouths of the land with silt were filled 
the horns of the barges were broken 
Aga the king of Kish in the midst of his army he took captive 
Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba 
to Aga speaks 
Aga my foreman Aga my lieutenant 
Aga my commander of the troops 
Aga gave me breath Aga gave me life 
Aga a fugitive into his embrace took 
Aga the fleeing bird with grain provided 
Uruk the handiwork of the gods 
the great wall the wall which An founded 
the majestic residence which An established 
you watch over You are its king and warrior 
an exuberant person a prince beloved of An 
Before Utu your former kindness is hereby repaid to you 
Aga to Kish he set free 
As to Gilgamesh lord of Kulaba 
your praise is sweet 
Enlil Gutium
the fanged snake of the mountain ranges
a people who acted violently against the gods
people who the kingship
of Sumer
to the mountains took away
who Sumer
with wickedness filled
who from one with a wife his wife
took away from him
who from one with a child his child
took away from him
who wickedness and violence
produced within the country
Enlil the king of all the lands
to obliterate its name
Utuegal
the mighty man
the king of Uruk
the king of the four world quarters
the king whose utterances cannot be countermanded
Enlil the king of all the lands
issued to him a command about this
To Inanna his lady
he went
and prayed to her saying
My lady lioness of battle
who the foreign lands batters
Enlil the kingship of Sumer
to return to its own control
he commanded me
May you be my ally
An army of many foreigners
bore down upon the land everywhere
Tirigan
the king of Gutium
opened its canal mouths
but no one came out against him
Both banks of the Tigris
he had seized
To the south in Sumer
the cultivated land he tied up
to the north the roads he tied up
On the highways of the country
he made tall grasses grow
But the king to whom Enlil
had given power
whom Inanna by her own heart had chosen
Utuegal the mighty man
from Uruk went out against him
In the temple of Ikur
he made an offering
To the citizens of his city
he was calling out saying
Gutium
Enlil has given to me
My mistress Inanna
is my ally
DumuziAmauumgalana
has declared It is something that concerns me
and Gilgame
the son of Ninsun
as bailiff he has given to me
The citizens of Uruk
and the citizens of Kullab
he caused to rejoice at this
His city as one man
followed after him
The military contingents and scouts
he put in good order
After having departed from the temple of Ikur
on the 4th day in Nagsu on the Enurigal canal
he made an offering
On the 5th day at BaraIlitappe
he made an offering
UrNinazu
and NabiEnlil
generals of Tirigan
who to Sumer as envoys
had been sent
he captured and put fetters on their hands
Having departed from BaraIlitappe
on the 6th day at Karkar
he made an offering
He went in to Ikur
and prayed to him
O Ikur Enlil has given me the weapons
may you be my ally
In the middle of that night he arose
and north of Adab
when Utu had risen
he went
and prayed to him saying
O Utu Gutium
Enlil has given to me
may you be my ally
At that place just beyond Gutium
he laid a trap for him
and the troops he drove to him
Utuegal the mighty man
defeated
their generals Whereupon Tirigan
king of Gutium
fled all alone from there
The place where to save his life
he had fled
in Dabrum they at first were good to him
But the people of Dabrum
Utuegal
because he a king to whom Enlil had given power
he was they had realized
Tirigan
they did not let go
By the envoys of Utuegal
Tirigan
and his wife and children
in Dabrum were captured
They placed fetters on his hands
and put a cloth blindfold over his eyes
Utuegal before Utu
made him lie at his Utus feet
and on his neck he set his foot
Gutium the fanged snake of the mountain ranges
he made drink from the cracks in the earth
At 
he made an offering
The towboats he dispatched from its borders
and the kingship of Sumer to its control he returned

provider of Ur 
king of Larsa 
king of Sumer and Akkad 
the king who the Ebabbar the temple of Utu 
did build 
and who the divine plans of the temples of the gods 
did restore 
when An Enlil Nanna and Utu 
a favorable reign of justice 
whose days have been prolonged 
did present to me 
by means of my broad wisdom 
greatly established  
and preeminent  
for my cities and land 
to produce good water
as well as the course and praise
of my heroism
today and afterwards 
to make highly resplendent 
to An and Enlil 
I made pleasing words 
and they to my righteous prayers  
having been agreeable 
for the digging of the Tigris 
and its restoring 
also through long days of life
to establish my name 
with their unalterable words
they issued orders to me 
At that time by the commands 
of An and Inanna 
with the agreement of Enlil and Ninlil 
and of Ikur my personal god
my helper 
and by the exalted power of Nanna and Utu 
the Tigris 
Utus river of abundance 
by means of my triumph 
I dug there in a grand fashion 
Up to the border territory my chosen boundary mound 
I brought its beginning 
and into a marsh 
I directed it in a great fashion 
Thus a constant water supply 
a ceaseless abundance 
to my city Larsa of the nation  
I established
When the Tigris the great river 
I dug 
the wages for one man were 
1 kor barley each 
2 sila bread each 
4 sila beer each 
and 2 shekels oil each 
in one day 
thusly they received it
Either a man less wages 
or a man more wages 
I did not let him take
Through the strength of the land 
I completed that work 
By means of the commands and divine decisions 
of the great gods 
the Tigris the wide river 
I returned to its former place
and so for all future time 
I have indeed made my name stand forth 
For Utu 
his master 
Siniddinam 
the mighty man 
provider of Ur 
king of Larsa 
and king of Sumer and Akkad

At that time through the willingness 
of my master 
the Ebabbar his beloved temple 
I built for him 
Like a lifted up mountain range 
I raised up its top for him 
and in his residence which pleases the heart 
I let Utu dwell
For Utu

For that which was done   
may Utu 
rejoice over him  
and a good life 
whose days will be made great 
as a gift 
may he allot to him 
When Utu the shrine Ebabbars 
fate did determine 
to perfect the divine attributes and plans 
to enlarge its residence
to enlarge its residence
and greatly to 
 he having spoken 
then it was towards me Siniddinam 
the mighty man 
the provider of Ur 
the king of Larsa 
and king of Sumer and Akkad 
that youthful Utu out of all the lands 
did direct his steadfast eye
To the shepherdship of Larsa 
he raised me up 
its troops of numerous areas 
at my command he made dwell 
and all the great orders for them 
he put fully into my hands 
His residence which gladdens his heart 
to enlarge widely 
in view of my reverence 
regarding it he gave me orders  
At that time Utu my master 
through my pleasing words of prayer 
any cause for complaint from my city  
he removed 
The army of Larsa 
I having made dwell together as one  
wages food ointment 
enough to please the heart 
to the men doing that work 
I did give
During a single year 
the baked bricks for it 
I baked there 
and the Ebabbar his beloved temple  
like a mountain range on a pure place 
its exalted high terrace
I built for him 
When the Ebabbar shrine itself 
I had built 
The wages per person were 
The wages per person were 
 kor of barley each 
2 sila of dates each 
2 sila of cheese each 
2 sila of sesame bran each

thus one received 
In the days of my excellent reign 
which Utu my master 
gave to me 
4 kor barely 
12 kur dates 
15 minas of wool 
3 ban oil 
5 ban of lard 
at the market rate in Ur 
Larsa and in my land
1 shekel silver 
thusly did purchase
Siniddinam the great prince  
who carried off the lower lands 
at that time with a shining countenance 
which gladdens the heart of my city

determined his destiny 
which like his name is surpassing

whose wide shadow he therefore made to be over all the lands 
at its base he multiplied the Black Headed People  
they who betook their lives there  
its great wall I built
Like a verdant mountin range I made it grow upon a pure place 
Like its name and majesty I raised up its top there 
As a marvel of the nation I made it appear greatly resplendent 
When I built the wall of Ur 
the wages for one man were 3 ban barley 
2 sila bread 2 sila beer 
and 2 shekels oil 
one received this per one day
Throughout my country I removed complaints
With my shining brow and happiness of heart

That wall Nanna Makes Firm the Foundation of the Country  
I named 
For my deed 
O Nanna my master may you rejoice over me  
and may days of happiness a reign of abundance

To DingirMardu 
his god 
for the life 
of WaradSn 
the king of Larsa 
Allarapi 
son of Ukua 
as his servant
dedicated it this object 
When An and Enlil 
the eternal princes the fathers of the gods 
they who decide the fates 
to Nanna the good son 
the beloved of the Ekur  
who daily in humility 
while prostrating himself  
standing before them 
heeds what they say
and bows to their commands  
they spoke to him happily 
The counsel of heaven and earth  
the good advice and divine decisions of the Anunna gods 
they placed in his hands 
In his city Ur the demarcated territory of the gods  
to exercise a good reign for the future 
to raise high its daises 
and all the assembly of living beings 
to make bear tribute
and set it down at his feet and his hands 
their holy word which cannot be altered 
they firmly spoke

wise as to decisions the son of Ninlil 
who before An and Enlil 
in beauty had come forth head held high 
who soothes the land with his word 
who has faithfully manifested it to the Black Headed People  
and has shown compassion to its numerous people 
in his city Ur the weak mother of the land 
with his shining brow and happy heart
he looked at her
and having raised his head  
he made it acquire an exalted name 
Letting it have the use of the abundance of the sea and mountains 
and as well making it rush into war and battle in the nation   
he gave it as a gift
To provide refuge for the living 
to return what was their land to their control 
to establish water therein and so to prolong their lives 
by their word they brought him to do this 
For this WaradSn 
me the wise one possessing intelligence who loves what is right 
me who was colored in sacred fashion from the very womb of my mother 
he Nanna placed me in the position of shepherd in his land 
For my rectitude he gave me the scepter 
bestowed upon me a happy reign 
and made his numerous people dwell under my command  
To renovate the Etemenniguru temple 
to thicken the base of the shrine Ebabbar 
to rebuild the cities of the gods of the land 
to  their fallen 
to raise high the old divine plans 
to restore their forgotten lustration rites
Nanna the lord who perfects the divine attributes of heaen and earth 
because of my reverence he ordered me to do this 
My counsel for that is a superior thing  
my skillful care is a thing that cannot be disrupted 
About lettiing my people know the ways of my kingship 
about making my greatness and majesty exist forever 
about widening Ur   
expanding its platform
and greater than previously  
enlarging its grounds  
after I had inquired about these things I trod after him 
and humbly I addressed pleas to him

For my life and the life 
of Kudurmabuk the father who begot me

whose name is surpassing 
with top reaching the heavens 
whose arms seek with the hands the put inquiries 
whose wide shadow covers foreign land as well as the nation 
from whose good base the Black Headed People 
he has multiplied those who betake their lives there 
the building of its wall he placed in my hands  
In the middle of that five months had not elapsed 
when I had baked its bricks
I finished that great wall 
and raised up its parapets 
Like a verdant mountain range I made it grow on a pure place 
Its height I made surpassing and set free its awesome radiance 
Commensurate with its name and greatness I raised up its top 
As a marvel of the nation 
I made it grandly resplendent  
In its foundations for the foundation documents of my kingship 
I sought out the place 
I raised the top of its main gate 
I strengthened its demarcating levee 
circled it with bricks 
and dug its moat 
I heaped up its  
When the wall of Ur 
I built 
the wages for one man were 3 ban barley 
2 sila bread 2 sila beer 2 shekels oil

From the midst of my land

Samsuiluna
Iluni the king of Enunna
who did not heed his words
he held onto
With his neck held in a neckstock
he brought him in
and his life he slew with a knife
All of Sumer and Akkad
he caused to be of one mind
The four world quarters
under his command he caused to dwell
At that time Samsuiluna the mighty man
through the strength of his army
rebuilt the the city Ki
He dug its canal
and with much earth its foundation
Samsuiluna
the mighty king
king of Babylon
king of Ki
king who makes the four world quarters

her favorable omen
and assistance
performed
the man who of those who turned away from him in their 
bound their hands
one who evildoers
made disappear from the country
who a shining light among the numerous people
made come forth
foremost heir
of Hammurapi
the ruler who broadened the country
the king who the land
of Idamaraz
from the border of Gutium
to the border of Elam
with his mighty weapon
did completely subjugate
and the widespread people of the land
of Idamaraz
did conquer
who all of the various fortresses
of the land of Warm
which had acted hostile to him
did strike with pickaxes
and who his victories
did so achieve
and his force of arms
did make brilliantly apparent 
When two months had passed
the people of the land of Idamaraz
which he had treated as booty
and the troops of Enunna
as many as he had taken as captives
having set them free
and a lifegiving hand
having put out to them
the various fortresses of the country
of Warum
which he had destroyed
having rebuilt
and their scattered people
having gathered up again
and returned to their places
then Samsuiluna the mighty man
that the people who on the banks of the Durul
and the aban rivers
were dwelling
could live in peaceful residences
that they may have no persons terrifying them
and that the mighty force
of his heroism
the whole land might praise
within two months time
on the bank of the Durul canal
Fort Samsuiluna
he built
Its ditch
he dug there
heaped up its earth there
formed the bricks for it
and built that fortress there
Its top like a mountain range
he raised up there
Because of this
An Enlil
Marduk
Enki
and Inanna
a mighty weapon
that has no rival
and life which like that of Nanna
and Utu
is everlasting
as his destiny
they determined for him
and presented to him as a gift
As for this wall
Enlil Made

All Bow Down To Him is its name
which he named

When Enlil
the king of the gods
the great lord of all the lands
towards Utu his gracious eyes
did direct
and of Sippar
his ancient city and cult site
its wall to build
the Ebabbar temple
to restore
of his ziggurrat and lofty high terrace
its top to raise as high as the sky
and Utu and his consort erda
into their sacred residence
to introduce amidst very happy rejoicing
with his word which cannot be altered
he spoke to him 
At that time
for the hero youthful Utu
a great destiny that by Enlil
regarding Sippar and the Ebabbar temple
had been decreed
happily
was set in place for him
To me Samsuiluna
the king created by him
he spoke happily
and he issued to me the order for it
At that time
all of Sumer and Akkad
whose people had become hostile to me
within one year
eight times
I struck them with weapons
The various cities of my enemies
I turned into mounds and ruins
The enemies
and evildoers
I tore out from the country their foundations
and the whole land
I made dwell under my command
From the time long ago
when the brickwork of the Ebabbar temple
had been constructed
among the kings who had gone before
no king
had been favored by Utu
and so the wall of Sippar
he had not built
But I Samsuiluna
one loved by Utu
and erda
the mighty king
king of Babylon
king of the four world quarters
the king whose utterances
with Utu
and erda have found favor
at the commands of Utu
and Marduk
through an army levy
of my land
in the middle of that year
its bricks for it I had formed
and the wall of Sippar
I raised up like a great mountain
I renovated the Ebabbar
their exalted high terrace of the ziggurrat
I raised up its top like the sky
and Utu Ikur
and erda
into their sacred residence
amidst very happy rejoicing
I introduced
To the Ebabbar
I returned its favorable guardian genius
That which to the welfare of Utu Ikur
and erda
was pleasing I did
and that commanded by Utu
and Marduk

For Nanna
the lord the great lion of heaven and earth
his master
IbbiSn
the god of his country
the sovereign who how every sort of divine attribute
should be properly performed knows fully
the mighty king
king of Ur
and king of the four world quarters
when in Susa
Adama
and the land of Awan
he roared like a storm
made them submit in a single day
and took their lords into captivity
because Nanna
had brought them back in his great arm
and had taken away their heavy gold and dark silver
IbbiSn
the prince with great power clad in fearsomeness
with wide intelligence 
a golden seventeat jar
whose openings let out honeyed water
whose golden drinking reed
is a channel running majestically
a thing fit for the firstfruits offerings
whose copper sickles
are strong multiple reed 
a mountain range growing pure clean junipers
with breasts making things numerous
for youthful Suen
which are unceasing 
for his life
he dedicated it to him
A person who the order of an evil thing
shall issue regarding it
and from the exalted platform of the divine dining hall
and the festival place
of Nanna
shall cause it to be held back
may the great gods of heaven and earth
curse him
O Enlil with exalted utterances your judgments being high and wide 
issuing divine decisions whose word cannot be altered with  planning placed in his hands 
ImeDagan the strong young man with the muscles and body of a lion strong youth possessing fearsomeness 
who alone is exalted lord whose called good name is demonstrated in all lands 
under his sway he has made the living creatures numerous 
and into whose hand were given the Black Headed People in their shelters where the people reside 
They prepared correctly for him the firstfruit offerings of the land 
They are not merely left to him in his good palace 
At that time ImeDagan the youth the hero of the runners 
to Nippur being the city where the seed of the myriad people sprang up where the living were born 
the reverent runner who serves night and day without ceasing 
who daily brings everything needed made a great resolution 
When he rises up it is gigantic a flood bringing a wind in its fury 
With his arms swinging open over and over he flashes across distant miles 
like a fierce lion of the steppe going with strength and youthfulness 
opening wide his knees on the highway striding towards battle and combat 
like a horse  on the highway with its tail extended 
like a buck when racing around inspiring fear  
whose his knees when set free are untiring  
the son who brings everything for Enlil 
and also that which gladdens the heart of Ninlil 
the king cares unceasingly for the lapis lazuli shrine 
At that time ImeDagan a copper statue which inspires fear as it races against the storm 
in the temple clad in fearsomeness upon his most precious dais 
he set it up and colored it brilliantly 
The great prince of the whole heaven the lord whose utterance cannot be altered 
his shining brow and raised righteous eyes 
may he let be upon him directed towards the faithful shepherd whom he has engendered 
But a king who orders a wicked thing 
and erases this inscription and writes his own name upon it 
or because of this curse incites another person to do it 
may Enlil my master and Ninli my mistress curse that person 
May Enki Ikur Ezinu and akan the lords of abundance 
after locking up abundance in heaven and earth  him evilly 
For Ninlil the exalted queen  
most resplendant of of the Anuna gods 
 in heaven and earth 
like  
their daises 
their daises 
their daises 
their daises 
for kingship 
he the one given the crown and scepter
for the great mother of the Anuna gods 
the mistress of the Kiur 
the exalted shrine Ekurs 
divine attributes to select 
the Nippur shrine Durankis 
ritual lustrations to cleanse 
to make the divine rites that had fallen away 
reappear magnificently
and Nippur the bellwether of the nation
to restore to its previous state
it was UrNinurta
the one serving the Ekur
upon whom Enlil the king of all the lands
out over the broad population
did lift his eye
and did rightly choose
for An Enlil and Ninlil
I removed evil
and in the shining Ekur temple in the city  
I set them up for them
Further copper figures whose bodily features  
were made to resemble me 
with an offering kid
were made in miniature 
and set up for the delivering of my prayers 
as the main courtyard of the Gagiuas  
ornament I fashioned for her Ninlil 
and for my life
I dedicated them to her
A person who an order of wickedness  
shall issue against it
and my creation 
shall efface
by the exalted command of Enlil
 may his revealed name   
be revoked from within the Ekur
May Ninurta the mighty warrior of Enlil 
be the inseparable bailiff for this
for an eternity of days
To Enlil the king of all the lands 
his master 
Enlilbni
the mighty king king of Isin 
and king of Sumer and Akkad 
beloved of Enlil 
and Nininsina

king IddinDagn  
fashioned two big copper statues 
but did not bring them to Nippur 
From the hands of IddinDagn 
until king Enlilbni 
it was 117 years 
that they stood in Isin 
Ninlil with a happy heart 
desired it and gave command and so  
Enlilbni the strong king 
king of Isin king of Sumer and Akkad 
beloved of Enlil and Ninlil 
those two big copper statues 
from within Isin 
to Nippur he had brought 
In the great courtyard of the Gageua temple 
before Ninlil his mistress he set them up 
Because of this Ninlil 
the life of Enlilbni 
from her place beside Enlil she lengthened its days 
A person who shall erase this inscription 
may Enlil my master and Ninlil my mistress 
curse him

While enraged Enlil answered Ninubur 
My child wished for great heaven and the great earth 
From the great heaven she set her mind on the great below 
From the great heaven the goddess set her mind on the great below 
From the great heaven Inana set her mind on the great below

She took a wig for her forehead 
She hung small lapislazuli beads around her neck 
She placed twin eggshaped beads on her breast 
She covered her body with a pala dress the garment of ladyship 
She placed mascara Let a man come let him come on her eyes 
She pulled the pectoral Come man come over her breast 
She placed a golden ring on her hand 
She held the lapislazuli measuring rod and measuring line in her hand 
Inanna traveled towards the underworld 
Her minister Ninubur traveled behind her 
Holy Inanna says to Ninubur 
Come my faithful minister of Eanna 
my minister who speaks fair words 
my escort who speaks trustworthy words 
On this day I will descend to the underworld 
When I have arrived in the underworld 
make a lament for me on the ruin mounds 
Beat the drum for me in the sanctuary 
Make the rounds of the houses of the gods for me 
Lacerate your eyes for me lacerate your nose for me 
In private lacerate your buttocks for me 
Like a pauper clothe yourself in a single garment 
and all alone set your foot in the Ekur the house of Enlil 
When you have entered the Ekur the house of Enlil 
lament before Enlil 
Father Enlil dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
If Enlil does not help you in this matter go to Ur 
In the Emukura at Ur 
when you have entered the Ekinugal toward Nanna 
lament before Nanna 
Father Nanna dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
And if Nanna does not help you in this matter go to Eridu 
In Eridu when you have entered the house of Enki 
lament before Enki 
Father Enki dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
Father Enki the lord of great wisdom 
knows about the lifegiving plant and the lifegiving water 
He is the one who will restore me to life 
When Inanna traveled on towards the underworld 
her minister Ninubur traveled on behind her 
She says to her minister Ninubur 
Go now my Ninubur and pay attention 
Dont neglect the instructions I gave you 
When Inanna arrived at the palace Ganzer 
she pushed aggressively on the door of the underworld 
She shouted aggressively at the gate of the underworld 
Open up doorman open up 
Open up Neti open up I am all alone and I want to come in 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
answers holy Inanna 
Who are you 
I am Inanna going to the east 
If you are Inanna going to the east 
why have you traveled to the land of no return 
How did you set your heart on the road whose traveller never returns 
Holy Inanna answers him 
Because lord Gudgalana 
the husband of my elder sister holy Erekigal has died 
in order to have his funeral rites observed 
she offers generous libations at his wake that is the reason 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
answers holy Inanna 
Stay here Inanna I will speak to my mistress 
I will speak to my mistress Erekigal and tell her what you have said 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
to his mistress Erekigal 
entered the house and said 
My mistress there is a lone girl outside 
It is Inanna your sister and she has arrived at the palace Ganzer 
She pushed aggressively on the door of the underworld 
She shouted aggressively at the gate of the underworld 
She has abandoned Eanna and has descended to the underworld 
She has taken the 7 divine powers 
She has collected the divine powers and grasped them in her hand 
She has come on her way with all the good divine powers 
She has put a turban headgear for the open country on her head 
She has taken a wig for her forehead 
She has hung small lapislazuli beads around her neck 
She has placed twin eggshaped beads on her breast 
She has covered her body with the pala dress of ladyship 
She has placed mascara Let a man come on her eyes 
She has pulled the pectoral Come man come over her breast 
She has placed a golden ring on her hand 
She is holding the lapislazuli reed1ninda measuring rod and measuring line in her hand 
When she heard this Erekigal slapped the side of her thigh 
She bit her lip and took the words to heart 
She says to Neti her chief doorman 
Come Neti my chief doorman of the underworld 
dont neglect the instructions I will give you 
Let the seven gates of the underworld be bolted 
Then let each door of the palace Ganzer be opened separately 
As for her after she has entered 
and crouched down and had her clothes removed they will be carried away 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
paid attention to the instructions of his mistress 
He bolted the 7 gates of the underworld 
Then he opened each of the doors of the palace Ganzer separately 
He says to holy Inanna 
Come on Inanna and enter 
And when Inanna entered 
the turban headgear for the open country was removed from her head 
What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled 
Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
When she entered the 2nd gate 
the small lapislazuli beads were removed from her neck 
What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled 
Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
When she entered the 3rd gate 
the twin eggshaped beads were removed from her breast 
What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled 
Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
When she entered the 4th gate 
the pectoral Come man come was removed from her breast 
What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled 
Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
When she entered the 5th gate 
the golden ring was removed from her hand 
What is this

When she entered the 7th gate 
the pala dress the garment of ladyship was removed from her body 
What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled 
Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
After she had crouched down and had her clothes removed they were carried away 
Then she made her sister Erekigal rise from her throne 
and instead she sat on her throne 
The Anuna the seven judges rendered their decision against her 
They looked at herit was the look of death 
They spoke to herit was the speech of anger 
They shouted at herit was the shout of heavy guilt 
The afflicted woman was turned into a corpse 
And the corpse was hung on a hook 
After 3 days and 3 nights had passed 
her minister Ninubur 
carried out the instructions of her mistress 
She made a lament for her in her ruined houses 
She beat the drum for her in the sanctuaries 
She made the rounds of the houses of the gods for her 
She lacerated her eyes for her she lacerated her nose 
In private she lacerated her buttocks for her 
Like a pauper she clothed herself in a single garment 
and all alone she set her foot in the Ekur the house of Enlil 
When she had entered the Ekur the house of Enlil 
she laments before Enlil 
Father Enlil dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
In his rage father Enlil answers Ninubur 
My daughter craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well 
Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well 
The divine powers of the underworld are divine powers which should not be craved for whoever gets them must remain in the underworld 
Who having got to that place could then expect to come up again 
Thus father Enlil did not help in this matter so she went to Ur 
In the Emudkura at Ur 
when she had entered the Ekinugal the house of Nanna 
she laments before Nanna 
Father Nanna dont let your daughter be killed in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
In his rage father Nanna answers Ninubur 
My daughter craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well 
Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well 
The divine powers of the underworld are divine powers which should not be craved for whoever gets them must remain in the underworld 
Who having got to that place could then expect to come up again 
Thus father Nanna did not help her in this matter so she went to Eridu 
In Eridu when she had entered the house of Enki 
xshe laments before Enkixx 
Father Enki dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
Father Enki answered Ninubur 
What has my daughter done She has me worried 
What has Inanna done She has me worried 
What has the mistress of all the lands done She has me worried 
What has the hierodule of An done She has me worried 
He removed some dirt from the tip of his fingernail and created the kurgar 
He removed some dirt from the tip of his 2nd fingernail and created the galatur 
To the kurgar he gave the lifegiving plant 
To the galatura he gave the lifegiving water 
Then father Enki speaks out to the galatura and the kurgar 
Go and direct your steps to the underworld 
Flit past the door like flies 
Slip through the door pivots like phantoms 
The birthmother on account of her children 
Erekigal is lying there 
Her holy shoulders are not covered by a linen cloth 
Her breasts are not full like a cagan vessel 
Her nails are like a pickaxe  upon her 
The hair on her head is bunched up as if it were leeks 
When she says Oh my heart 
you are to say You are troubled our mistress oh your heart 
When she says Oh my liver 
you are to say You are troubled our mistress oh your liver 
She will then ask Who are you 
Speaking to you from my heart to your heart from my liver to your liver 
if you are gods let me talk with you 
if you are mortals may a destiny be decreed for you 
Make her swear this by heaven and earth 
Go on out 
They will offer you a riverful of waterdont accept it 
They will offer you a field with its graindont accept it 
But say to her Give us the corpse hanging on the hook 
She will answer That is the corpse of your queen 
Say to her Whether it is that of our king whether it is that of our queen give it to us 
She will give you the corpse hanging on the hook 
1 of you sprinkle on it the lifegiving plant and 1 the lifegiving water 
Thus let Inanna rise up 
The galatura and the kurgar paid attention to the instructions of Enki 
They flitted through the door like flies 
They slipped through the door pivots like phantoms 
The birthmother because of her children 
Erekigal was lying there 
Her holy shoulders were not covered by a linen cloth 
Her breasts were not full like a cagan vessel 
Her nails were like a pickaxe  upon her 
The hair on her head was bunched up as if it were leeks 
When she said Oh my heart 
they said to her You are troubled our mistress oh your heart 
When she said Oh my liver 
they said to her You are troubled our mistress oh your liver 
Then she asked Who are you 
I tell you from my heart to your heart from my liver to your liver 
if you are gods I will talk with you 
if you are mortals may a destiny be decreed for you 
They made her swear this by heaven and earth 
they went on out 
they were offered a river with its waterthey did not accept it 
They were offered a field with its grainthey did not accept it 
They said to her Give us the corpse hanging on the hook 
Holy Erekigal answers the galatura and the kurgar 
The corpse is that of your queen 
They said to her Whether it is that of our king or that of our queen give it to us 
They were given the corpse hanging on the hook 
1 of them sprinkled on it the lifegiving plant and 1 the lifegiving water 
And thus Inanna rose up 
Erekigal says to the galatura and the kurgar 
Bring your queen  your  has been seized 
Inanna because of Enkis instructions was about to ascend from the underworld 
But as Inanna was about to ascend from the underworld 
the Anuna seized her 
Who has ever ascended from the underworld has ascended unscathed from the underworld 
If Inanna is to ascend from the underworld 
let her provide a substitute for herself 
So when Inanna left the underworld 
the one in front of her though not a minister held a sceptre in his hand 
the one behind her though not an escort carried a mace at his hip 
while the small demons like a reed enclosure 
and the big demons like the reeds of a fence restrained her on all sides 
Those who accompanied her 
those who accompanied Inanna 
know no food know no drink 
eat no flour offering 
and drink no libation 
They accept no pleasant gifts 
They take away the child hanging on a wetnurses breasts 
They crush no bitter garlic 
They eat no fish they eat no leeks 
They it was who accompanied Inanna 
After Inanna had ascended from the underworld 
Ninubur threw herself at her feet at the door of the Ganzer 
She had sat in the dust and clothed herself in a filthy garment 
The demons said to holy Inanna 
Inanna proceed to your city we will take her back 
Holy Inanna answers the demons 
This is my minister of fair words 
my escort of trustworthy words 
She did not forget my instructions 
She did not neglect the orders I gave her 
She made a lament for me on the ruin mounds 
She beat the drum for me in the sanctuaries 
She made the rounds of the gods houses for me 
She lacerated her eyes for me lacerated her nose for me 
In private she lacerated her buttocks for me 
Like a pauper she clothed herself in a single garment 
To the house of Enlil 
and to Ur to the house of Nanna 
and to Eridu to the house of Enki 
all alone she directed her steps 
She brought me back to life 
How could I turn her over to you 
Let us go on Let us go on to the egkuraga in Umma 
At the egkuraga in Umma 
ara in his own city threw himself at her feet 
He had sat in the dust and dressed himself in a filthy garment 
The demons say to holy Inanna 
Inanna proceed to your city we will take him back 
Holy Inanna answered the demons 
ara is my singer 
my manicurist and my hairdresser 
How could I turn him over to you 
Let us go on Let us go on to the Emukalama in Badtibira 
At the Emukalama in Badtibira 
Lulal in his own city threw himself at her feet 
He had sat in the dust and clothed himself in a filthy garment 
The demons said to holy Inanna 
Inanna proceed to your city we will take him back 
Holy Inanna answers the demons 
Outstanding Lulal follows me at my right and my left 
How could I turn him over to you 
Let us go on Let us go on to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba 
They followed her to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba 
There was Dumuzi clothed in a magnificent garment and seated magnificently on a throne 
The demons seized him there by his thighs 
The 7 of them poured the milk from his churns 
The seven of them shook their heads like  
They would not let the shepherd play the pipe and flute before her  
She looked at him it was the look of death 
She spoke to him  it was the speech of anger 
She shouted at him  it was the shout of heavy guilt 
How much longer Take him away 
Holy Inanna gave Dumuzi the shepherd into their hands 
Those who had accompanied her 
who had come for Dumuzi 
know no food know no drink 
eat no flour offering 
drink no libation 
They never enjoy the pleasures of the marital embrace 
never have any sweet children to kiss 
They snatch the son from a mans knee 
They make the bride leave the house of her fatherinlaw 
Dumuzi let out a wail and turned very pale 
The lad raised his hands to heaven to Utu 
Utu you are my brotherinlaw 
I am your relation by marriage I brought butter oil to your mothers house 
I brought cheese to Ningals house 
Turn my hands into snakes hands 
and turn my feet into snakes feet 
so I can escape my demons let them not keep hold of me 
Utu accepted his tears 
Utu turned Dumuzis hands into snakes hands 
He turned his feet into snakes feet 
Dumuzi escaped his demons 
having seized  
Holy Inanna  her heart 
Holy Inanna  her heart 
Holy Inanna  her heart 
Holy Inanna wept bitterly for her husband 
Holy Inanna  Dumuzi  her heart  
 her husband  by force  
 like  
 like  
She tore at her hair like esparto grass she ripped it out like esparto grass 
You wives who lie in your mens embrace where is my precious husband 
You children who lie in your mens embrace where is my precious child 
Where is my man Where  
Where is my man Where  
A fly speaks to holy Inanna 
If I show you where your man is what will be my reward 
Holy Inanna answers the fly 
If you show me where my man is I will give you this gift 
I will cover   
The fly helped  holy Inanna 
The young lady Inanna decreed the destiny of the fly 
In the beerhouse and the tavern  may there  for you 
You will live  like the sons of the wise 
Now Inanna decreed this fate and thus it came to be 
 was weeping 
She came up to the sister  and  by the hand 
Now alas my  
You for half the year and your sister for half the year 
when you are demanded on that day you will stay 
when your sister is demanded on that day you will be released 
Thus holy Inanna gave Dumuzi as a substitute  
Holy Erekigal

After the flood had swept over 
and brought about the destruction of the countries 
when mankind was made to endure 
and the seed of mankind was preserved 
and the blackheaded people all rose 
when An and Enlil 
called the name of mankind 
and established rulership 
but kingship and the crown of the city 
had not yet come out from heaven 
and Ningirsu the hoe and the spade 
the earth basket and the plough which mean life for the Land 
had not yet established for the multitude of wellguarded  people 
 in those days the carefree youth of man 
lasted for 1 years 
and following his upbringing he lasted for another 1 years 
However he did not do any work 
He became smaller and smaller  
his sheep died  in the sheepfold 
In those days because the water of Laga was held back 
there was famine in irsu 
Canals were not dug 
the levees and ditches were not cleaned 
The large arable tracts were not  
there was no water to irrigate abundantly all the cultivated fields 
the people relied on rain 
Anan did not make dappled barley grow 
furrows were not yet opened 
they bore no yield 
the high plain was not tilled 
it bore no yield 
None of the countries with numerous people for the gods 
emmer beer liquor  
sweet liquor or  
did they libate 
Large fields with the plough 
they did not till for them 
The river  
Its field 
In order to dig canals 
to clean the levees and ditches 
to  the large arable tracts 
to  all the cultivated fields 
The pickaxe the spade the earth basket and the plough 
which mean life for the Land 
he established for the people 
Then to making barley sprout 
he did turn his attention 
He made the people stand before the maiden 
Day and night at the appointed times 
they raised their heads 
Before Anan who makes the seeds grow 
they prostrated themselves and she made them grow  
Before  Anan who makes the dappled barley grow

From the years of AmarSuena 
of AmarSuena 
until King IbbiSuen 
chose Enamgalana by extispicy as the high priest of inanna of Uruk 
Ninlil came regularly to the Tummal 
Written according to the words of Luinanna the chief leatherworker of Enlil 
IbiErra who looks after the Ekur 
built the storehouse of Enlil 
To  the sanctuary like a cargo ship
to  its great furnaces
to see that its canals  waters of joy for eternity
to see that the hoes till the arable tracts and that  the fields
to turn the house of Ki which was like a haunted town into a living settlement again
its king shepherd UrZababa
rose like Utu over the house of Ki
However to alter his term of reigning and to remove the prosperity of the palace
An and Enlil authoritatively  decided  by their holy command
Then Sargon  his city was the city of 
his father was Laibum his mother 
Sargon  with happy heart
Since he was born 
One day after the evening had arrived
and Sargon had brought the regular deliveries to the palace
He UrZababa was sleeping and dreaming in the holy bedchamber his holy residence
He realised what the dream was about but did not put into words did not discuss it with anyone
After Sargon had received the regular deliveries for the palace
UrZababa appointed him cupbearer putting him in charge of the drinks cupboard
Holy inanna did not cease to stand by him
After five or 1 days had passed
King UrZababa  and became frightened in his residence
Like a lion he urinated sprinkling his legs and the urine contained blood and pus
He was troubled he was disturbed like a fish living in brackish water
It was then that the cupbearer of Ezinas winehouse
Sargon lay down not to sleep but lay down to dream
In the dream holy inanna drowned UrZababa in a river of blood
The sleeping Sargon groaned and gnawed the ground
When King UrZababa heard about this groaning
he was brought into the kings holy presence
Sargon was brought into the presence of UrZababa who said
Cupbearer was a dream revealed to you in the night
Sargon answered his king
My king this is my dream which I will tell you about
There was a young woman who was as high as the heavens and as broad as the earth
She was firmly set as the base of a wall
For me she drowned you in a great river a river of blood
UrZababa chewed his lips he became seriously afraid
He spoke to  his chancellor
My royal sister holy inanna
is going to change  my finger into a  of blood
she will drown Sargon the cupbearer in the great river
Belitikal chief smith man of my choosing who can write tablets
I will give you orders let my orders be carried out
Let my advice be followed
Now then when the cupbearer has delivered my bronze handmirror  to you
in the Esikil the fated house throw them the mirror and Sargon into the mould like statues
Belitikal heeded his kings words
and prepared the moulds in the Esikil the fated house
The king spoke to Sargon
Go and deliver my bronze handmirror  to the chief smith
Sargon left the palace of UrZababa
Holy inanna however did not cease to stand at his right hand side
and before he had come within five or 1 ninda of the Esikil the fated house
holy inanna turned around toward him and blocked his way saying
The Esikil is a holy house No one polluted with blood should enter it
Thus he met the chief smith of the king only at the gate of the fated house
After he delivered the kings bronze handmirror  to the chief smith
Belitikal the chief smith  and threw it into the mould like statues
After five or 1 days had passed Sargon
came into the presence of UrZababa his king
he came into the palace firmly founded like a great mountain
King UrZababa  and became frightened in his residence
He realised what was it about but did not put into words did not discuss it with anyone
UrZababa became frightened in the bedchamber his holy residence
He realised what was it about but did not put into words did not discuss it with anyone
In those days although writing words on tablets existed putting tablets into envelopes did not yet exist
King UrZababa despatched Sargon the creature of the gods
with a message written on clay which was about murdering Sargon
to Lugalzagesi in Uruk
With the wife of Lugalzagesi 
She gave her feminity as a shelter 
Lugalzagesi did not  the envoy
Come He directed his steps to brickbuilt Eana
Lugalzagesi did not grasp it he did not talk to the envoy
But as soon as he did talk to the envoy 
Alas and sat in the dust
Lugalzagesi replied to the envoy
Envoy Sargon does not yield
After he has submittedSargon  Lugalzagesi 
Sargon  Lugalzagesi 
Why  Sargon 
After Enlils frown 
had slain Ki as if it were the Bull of Heaven 
had slaughtered the house of the land of Uruk in the dust as if it were a mighty bull 
Then to Sargon king of Agade 
from the south as far as the highlands did Enlil 
give the rulership and kingship 
at that time holy inanna established the sanctuary of Agade 
as her celebrated womans domain 
she set up her throne in Ulma 
Like a young man building a house for the first time 
like a girl establishing a womans domain 
So that the warehouses would be provisioned 
that dwellings would be founded in the city 
that its people would eat splendid food 
that its people would drink splendid beverages 
that those bathed for holidays would rejoice in the courtyards 
that the people would throng the places of celebration 
that acquaintances would dine together 
that foreigners would cruise about like unusual birds in the sky 
that even Marhai would be reentered on the tribute rolls 
that monkeys mighty elephants water buffalo exotic animals 
would jostle each other in the public squares 
as well as thoroughbred dogs lions mountain ibexes and alum sheep with long wool 
holy inanna did not sleep as she ensured all of this 
She then filled Agades stores for emmer wheat with gold 
she filled its stores for white emmer wheat with silver 
she delivered copper tin and blocks of lapis lazuli to its granaries 
and sealed its silos from outside 
She endowed its old women with the gift of giving counsel 
she endowed its old men with the gift of eloquence 
She endowed its young women with the gift of entertaining 
she endowed its young men with martial might 
she endowed its little ones with joy 
The nursemaids who cared for the generals children 
played the drumsticks 
Inside the city tigi drums sounded outside it flutes and zamzam instruments 
Its harbour where ships moored was full of joy 
All foreign lands rested contentedly 
and their people experienced happiness 
Its king the shepherd NaramSuen 
rose as the daylight on the holy throne of Agade 
Its city wall like a mountain reached the heavens 
Its citygates were like the Tigris going to the sea 
when Inanna opened its portals 
and made Sumer bring its own possessions upstream by boats 
The highland Martu people ignorant of agriculture 
brought spirited cattle and kids for her 
The Meluans the people of the black land 
brought exotic wares up to her 
Elam and Subir loaded themselves with goods for her as if they were packasses 
All the governors the temple administrators 
and the accountants of the Guedina 
regularly supplied the monthly and New Year offerings 
What a weariness all these caused at Agades city gates 
Holy inanna could hardly receive all these offerings 
As if she were a citizen there she could not restrain  the desire  to prepare the ground for a temple 
But the statement coming from the Ekur was disquieting 
Because of Enlil  all Agade was reduced  to trembling 
and terror befell inanna in Ulma 
She left the city returning to her home 
Like someone abandoning the young women of her womans domain 
Holy inanna abandoned the sanctuary of Agade 
Like a warrior hurrying to arms 
she removed the gift of battle and fight from the city 
and handed them over to the enemy 
Not even five or 1 days had passed 
and the jewels of rulership the royal crown 
the emblem and the royal throne bestowed on Agade 
did Ninurta bring back into his Eumea 
Utu took away the eloquence of the city 
Enki took away its wisdom 
Its fearsomeness that reaches heaven 
An took up into the midst of heaven 
Its wellanchored holy mooring pole 
Enki tore out from the abzu 
inanna took away its weapons 
The life of Agades sanctuary was brought to an end as if it had been only the life of a tiny carp in the deep waters 
and all the cities were watching it 
Like a mighty elephant it bent its neck to the ground 
while they all raised their horns like mighty bulls 
Like a dying dragon it dragged its head on the earth 
and they jointly deprived it of honour as in a battle 
Enlil would not let the kingdom of Agade occupy a pleasant lasting residence 
that he would make its future altogether unfavourable 
that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures  
 NaramSuen saw that in a nocturnal vision 
He realised what the dream was about but did not put into words and did not discuss it with anyone 
 temples shake  
 perform  extispicy regarding  his temple  
Because of the Ekur he put on mourning clothes 
covered his chariot with a reed mat 
tore the reed canopy off his ceremonial barge 
and gave away his royal paraphernalia 
NaramSuen persisted for seven years 
Who has ever seen a king burying his head in his hands for seven years 
He realised what the dream was about but did not put into words and did not discuss it with anyone 
Then he went to perform extispicy on a kid regarding the temple 
but the omen had nothing to say about the building of the temple 
For a second time he went to perform extispicy on a kid regarding the temple 
but the omen again had nothing to say about the building of the temple 
In order to change what had been inflicted  upon him 
he tried to to alter Enlils pronouncement 
Because his subjects were dispersed 
he now began a mobilization of his troops 
Like a wrestler who is about to enter the great courtyard 
he  his hands towards  the Ekur 
Like an athlete bent to start a contest 
he treated the giguna as if it were worth only thirty shekels 
Like a robber plundering the city 
he set tall ladders against the temple 
To demolish Ekur as if it were a huge ship 
to break up its soil like the soil of mountains where precious metals are mined 
to splinter it like the lapis lazuli mountain 
to prostrate it like a city inundated by Ikur 
alhough the temple was not the Mountains of Cedarfelling 
he had large axes cast 
he had doubleedged agasilig axes sharpened to be used against it 
He set spades against its roots 
and it sank as low as the foundation of the Land 
He put axes against its top 
and the temple like a dead soldier bowed its neck before him 
and all the foreign lands bowed their necks before him 
He ripped out its drain pipes 
and all the rain went back to the heavens 
He tore off its upper lintel and the Land was deprived of its ornament 
From its Gate from which Grain is never Diverted he diverted grain 
and the Land was deprived of grain 
He struck the Gate of WellBeing with the pickaxe 
and wellbeing was subverted in all the foreign lands 
As if they were for great tracts of land with wide carpfilled waters 
he cast large spades to be used against the Ekur 
The people could see the bedchamber its room which knows no daylight 
They could look into the holy treasure chest of the gods 
its laama deities of the great pilasters standing at the temple 
though they had committed no sacrilege 
were thrown into the fire by NaramSuen 
The cedar cypress juniper and boxwood 
the woods of its giguna were  by him 
He put its gold in containers 
and put its silver in leather bags 
He filled the docks with its copper as if it were a huge transport of grain 
The silversmiths were reshaping its silver 
jewellers were reshaping its precious stones 
smiths were beating its copper 
Though they were not the goods of a plundered city 
large ships were moored at the temple 
large ships were moored at Enlils temple 
and its possessions were taken away from the city 
With the possessions being taken away from the city 
good sense left Agade 
As the ships moved away from the docks Agades intelligence was removed 
The roaring storm that subjugates the entire land 
the rising deluge that cannot be confronted 
Enlil was considering what should be destroyed in return for the wrecking of his beloved Ekur 
He lifted his gaze towards the Gubin mountains 
and made all the inhabitants of the broad mountain ranges descend  
Those who do not resemble other people who are not reckoned as part of the Land 
the Gutians an unbridled people 
with human intelligence but canine instincts and monkeys features  
Enlil brought them out of the mountains 
Like small birds they swooped on the ground in great flocks 
Because of Enlil they stretched their arms out across the plain like a net for animals 
Nothing escaped their clutches 
no one left their grasp 
Messengers no longer travelled the highways 
the couriers boat no longer passed along the rivers 
The Gutians drove the trusty  goats of Enlil out of their folds and compelled their herdsmen to follow them they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them 
they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them 
Prisoners manned the watch 
Brigands occupied the highways 
The doors of the city gates of the Land lay dislodged in mud 
and all the foreign lands uttered bitter cries from the walls of their cities 
They established gardens for themselves within the cities and not as usual on the wide plain outside 
As if it had been before the time when cities were built and founded 
the large arable tracts yielded no grain 
the inundated tracts yielded no fish 
the irrigated orchards yielded no syrup or wine 
the thick clouds  did not rain the magurum plant did not grow 
In those days oil for one shekel was only half a litre 
grain for one shekel was only half a litre 
wool for one shekel was only one mina 
fish for one shekel filled only one ban measure 
these sold at such prices in the markets of the cities 
Those who lay down on the roof died on the roof 
those who lay down in the house were not buried 
People were flailing at themselves from hunger 
By the Kiur Enlils great place 
dogs were packed together in the silent streets 
if two men walked there they would be devoured by them 
and if three men walked there they would be devoured by them 
Noses were punched  heads were smashed  
noses  were piled up heads were sown like seeds 
Honest people were confounded with traitors 
heroes lay dead on top of heroes 
the blood of traitors ran upon the blood of honest men 
At that time Enlil rebuilt his great sanctuaries 
into small reed  sanctuaries 
and from east to west he reduced their storehouses 
The old women who survived those days 
the old men who survived those days 
and the chief lamentation singer who survived those years 
for seven days and seven nights 
set up seven bala drums 
ub meze and lilis drums made them resound to Enlil like Ikur 
The old women did not restrain the cry Alas for my city 
The old men did not restrain the cry Alas for its people 
The lamentation singer did not restrain the cry Alas for the Ekur 
Its young women did not restrain from tearing their hair 
Its young men did not restrain from sharpening their knives 
Their laments were as if Enlils ancestors 
were performing a lament in the aweinspiring Holy Mound by the holy knees of Enlil 
Because of this Enlil entered his holy bedchamber and lay down fasting 
At that time Suen Enki inanna Ninurta Ikur Utu Nuska and Nisaba the great gods 
cooled Enlils heart with cool water and prayed to him 
Enlil may the city that destroyed your city be treated as your city has been treated 
May the one that defiled your giguna be treated as Nibru 
In this city may heads fill the wells 
May no one find his acquaintances there 
may brother not recognise brother 
May its young woman be cruelly killed in her womans domain 
may its old man cry in distress for his slain wife 
May its pigeons moan on their window ledges 
may its small birds be smitten in their nooks 
may it live in constant anxiety like a timid pigeon 
Again Suen Enki inanna Ninurta Ikur Utu Nuska and Nisaba all the gods whosoever 
turned their attention to the city 
and cursed Agade severely 
City you pounced on Ekur it is as if you had pounced on Enlil 
Agade you pounced on Ekur it is as if you had pounced on Enlil 
May your holy walls to their highest point resound with mourning 
May your giguna be reduced to a pile of dust 
May your pilasters with the standing lahama deities 
fall to the ground like tall young men drunk on wine 
May your clay be returned to its abzu 
may it be clay cursed by Enki 
May your grain be returned to its furrow 
may it be grain cursed by Ezina 
May your timber be returned to its forest 
may it be timber cursed by Ninilduma 
May the cattle slaughterer slaughter his wife 
may your sheep butcher butcher his child 
May water wash away your pauper as he is looking for  
May your prostitute hang herself at the entrance to her brothel 
May your pregnant  priestesses and cult prostitutes abort  their children 
May your gold be bought for the price of silver 
may your silver be bought for the price of pyrite  
and may your copper be bought for the price of lead 
Agade may your strong man be deprived of his strength 
so that he will be unable to lift his sack of provisions and  
and will not have the joy of controlling your superior asses may he lie idle all day 
May this make the city die of hunger 
May your citizens who used to eat fine food lie hungry 
may your  man 
eat the coating on his roof 
The leather hinges on the main door of his fathers house 
may he chew their leather hinges 
May depression descend upon your palace built for joy 
May the evils of the desert the silent place howl continuously 
Your uzga precinct established for purification ceremonies 
may foxes that frequent its ruin mounds and brush it with their tails 
Your gateways established for the Land 
May the ukuku the bird of depression make its nest in them 
In your city that could not sleep because of the tigi drums 
that could not rest from its joy 
may the bulls of Nanna that fill the pens 
bellow like those who wander in the desert the silent place 
May the grass grow long on your canalbank towpaths 
may the grass of mourning grow on your highways laid for waggons 
Moreover on your towpaths built up with canal sediment 
may  wild rams  and alert snakes of the mountains allow no one to pass 
In your plains where fine grass grows may the reed of lamentation grow 
Agade may brackish water flow where fresh water flowed for you 
If someone decides I will dwell in this city may he not enjoy the pleasures of a dwelling place 
If someone decides I will rest in Agade may he not enjoy the pleasures of a resting place 
And before Utu on that very day so it was 
On its canal bank towpaths the grass grew long 
On its highways laid for waggons the grass of mourning grew 
Moreover on its towpaths built up with canal sediment 
wild rams  and alert snakes of the mountains allowed no one to pass 
On its plains where fine grass grew now the reeds of lamentation grew 
Agades flowing fresh water flowed as brackish water 
When someone decided I will dwell in that city he could not enjoy the pleasures of a dwelling place 
When someone decided I will rest in Agade 
For the destruction of Agade Inanna be praised 
Enki took away its wisdom 
Its fearsomeness that reaches heaven 
An took it up into the midst of heaven 
Its wellanchored holy mooring pole 
Enki tore it out from the abzu 
That he would make its future altogether unfavourable 
that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures  
 NaramSuen saw that in a nocturnal vision 
as if he were to change what had been inflicted  upon him 
His subjects were dispersed 
so he began a mobilization of his troops

he  his hands towards  the Ekur

He had doubleedged agasilig axes sharpened to be used against it

he cast large spades 
He put spades against its roots

He struck the Gate of WellBeing with the pickaxe

Noses were punched heads were smashed  
Noses were punched heads were smashed

In his destroyed Ur its lament is bitter

Together with the lord whose house had been devastated his city was given over to tears 
Together with Nanna whose Land had perished 
Ur joined the lament 
The good woman to disquiet the lord concerning his city 
Ningal to give him no rest concerning his Land 
approached him for the sake of his city  bitterly she weeps 
She approached the lord for the sake of his house  bitterly she weeps 
She approached him for the sake of his devastated city  bitterly she weeps 
She approached him for the sake of his devastated house  before him she makes its bitter lament 
The woman after she had composed her song  for the tearful balag instrument 
herself utters softly a lamentation for the silent house 
The storm that came to be  its lamentation hangs heavy on me 
Raging about because of the storm 
I am the woman for whom the storm came to be 
The storm that came to be  
 its lamentation hangs heavy on me 
I trembled on account of that day 
but I did not flee before the days violence 
Because of this debilitating storm I could not see a good day for my rule not one good day for my rule 
The bitter lament having come to be for me during the night 
trembled on account of that night 
but I did not flee before the nights violence 
The awesomeness of this storm destructive as the flood truly hangs heavy on me 
Because of its existence in my nightly sleeping place even in my nightly sleeping place truly there was no peace for me 
Nor because of this debilitating storm was the quiet of my sleeping place not even the quiet of my sleeping place allowed to me 
2 mss add 1 line Truly I did not forsake my Land 
Because there was bitterness in my Land 
I trudged the earth like a cow for its calf 
My Land was not granted success 
Because there was bitter distress in my city 
I beat my wings like a bird of heaven 
and flew to my city 
and my city was destroyed in its foundations 
and Ur perished where it lay 
Because the hand of the storm appeared above 
I screamed and cried to it Return O storm to the plain 
The storms breast did not rise 
To me the woman in the Agrunkug my house of queenship 
they did not grant a reign of distant days 
Indeed they established weeping and lamentation for me 
As for the house which used to be where the spirit of the blackheaded people was soothed 
instead of its festivals wrath and terror indeed multiply 
Because of this debilitating storm into my house the favourable place 
my devastated righteous house upon which no eye had been cast 
depression and lament and bitterness 
lament and bitterness have been brought into it 
My house founded by the righteous 
was pushed over on its side like a garden fence 
For Ekinugal my house of royalty 
the good house my house which has been given over to tears 
its building falsely and its perishing truly  
they granted this to me as its lot and share 
As onto a tent a shelter on the denuded harvest ground 
as onto a shelter on the denuded harvest ground wind and rain have been made to fall on it 
Ur my allsurpassing chamber 
the house and the smitten city all have been uprooted 
Like a shepherds sheepfold it has been uprooted 
The swamp has swallowed my possessions accumulated in the city

On that day when such a storm had pounded 
when in the presence of the queen her city had been destroyed 
on that day when such a storm had been created 
when they had pronounced the utter destruction of my city 
when they had pronounced the utter destruction of Ur 
when they had directed that its people be killed 
on that day I did not abandon my city 
I did not forsake my land 
Truly I shed my tears before An 
Truly I myself made supplication to Enlil 
Let not my city be destroyed I implored them 
Let not Ur be destroyed I implored them 
Let not its people perish I implored them 
But An did not change that word 
Enlil did not soothe my heart with an It is good  so be it 
A second time when the council had settled itself in the preeminent place 
and the Anuna had seated themselves to ratify decisions 
I prostrated  myself and stretched out my arms 
Truly I shed my tears before An 
Truly I myself made supplication to Enlil 
Let not my city be destroyed I implored them 
Let not Ur be destroyed I implored them 
Let not its people perish I implored them 
But An did not change that word 
Enlil did not soothe my heart with an It is good  so be it 
They gave instructions that my city should be utterly destroyed 
They gave instructions that Ur should be utterly destroyed 
They decreed its destiny that its people should be killed 
In return for the speech  which I had given them 
they both bound me together with my city 
and also bound my Ur together with me 
An is not one to change his command 
and Enlil does not alter what he has uttered

The weapons in the city smash heads and consume indiscriminately 
The storm whirled gloom around the base of the horizon  the people groan 
In front of the storm heat blazes  the people groan 
A fiery glow burns with the raging storm 
After the haze had lifted at noon he made fires blaze 
He locked up the day and the rising of the bright sun together with the good storm 
In the Land he did not let the bright sun rise it shone like the evening star 
n the delightful night the time when coolness sets in he redoubled the south wind 
The scorching potsherds made the dust glow   the people groan 
He swept the winds over the blackheaded people  the people groan 
Sumer was overturned by a snare  the people groan 
It attacked  the Land and devoured it completely 
Tears cannot influence the bitter storm  the people groan 
The reaping storm dragged across the Land 
Like a flood storm it completely destroyed the city 
The storm that annihilates the Land silenced the city 
The storm that will make anything vanish came doing evil 
The storm blazing like fire performed its task upon the people 
The storm ordered by Enlil in hate the storm which wears away the Land 
covered Ur like a garment was spread out over it like linen

Its people littered its outskirts just as if they might have been broken potsherds 
Breaches had been made in its walls  the people groan 
On its lofty citygates where walks had been taken corpses were piled 
On its boulevards where festivals had been held heads lay scattered  
In all its streets where walks had been taken corpses were piled 
In its places where the dances of the Land had taken place people were stacked in heaps 
They made the blood of the Land flow down the wadis like copper or tin 
Its corpses like fat left in the sun melted away of themselves 
The heads of its men slain by the axe were not covered with a cloth 
Like a gazelle caught in a trap their mouths bit the dust 
Men struck down by the spear were not bound with bandages 
As if in the place where their mothers had laboured they lay in their own blood 
Its men who were finished off by the battlemace were not bandaged with new  cloth 
Although they were not drunk with strong drink their necks drooped on their shoulders 
He who stood up to the weapon was crushed by the weapon  the people groan 
He who ran away from it was overwhelmed  by the storm  the people groan 
The weak and the strong of Ur perished from hunger 
Mothers and fathers who did not leave their houses were consumed by fire 
The little ones lying in their mothers arms were carried off like fish by the waters 
Among the nursemaids with their strong embrace the embrace was pried open 
The Lands judgment disappeared  the people groan

Its queen like a bird in fright departed from her city 
Ningal like a bird in fright departed from her city 
All the treasures accumulated in the Land were defiled 
In all the storehouses abounding in the Land fires were kindled 
In its ponds Gibil the purifier relentlessly did his work 
The good house of the lofty untouchable mountain Ekinugal 
was entirely devoured by large axes 
The people of imaki and Elam the destroyers counted its worth as only thirty shekels 
They broke up the good house with pickaxes 
They reduced the city to ruin mounds

In the river of my city dust has gathered and the holes of foxes have been dug there 
In its midst no flowing water is carried its taxcollector is gone 
In the fields of my city there is no grain their farmer is gone 
My fields like fields from which the hoe has been kept away  have grown tangled  weeds 
My orchards and gardens that produced abundant syrup and wine have grown mountain thornbushes 
My plain that used to be covered in its luxurious verdure has become cracked  like a kiln 
My possessions like a flock of rooks rising up have risen in flight  I shall cry O my possessions

Men ignorant of gems have fastened my gems around their necks 
My small birds and fowl have flown away  I shall say Alas my city

I am Ningal whose city has been destroyed in place of whose city a strange city has been built 
Woe is me the city has been destroyed my house too has been destroyed 
Nanna the shrine Ur has been destroyed its people killed 
Woe is me where can I sit where can I stand 
Woe is me in place of my city a strange house is being erected 
I am the good woman in place of whose house a strange city is being built 
Upon its removal from its place from the plain I shall say Alas my people 
Upon my citys removal from Ur I shall say Alas my house 
The woman tears at her hair as if it were rushes 
She beats the holy ub drum at her chest she cries Alas my city 
Her eyes well with tears she weeps bitterly 
Woe is me my city which no longer exists  I am not its queen 
Nanna the shrine Ur which no longer exists  I am not its owner 
Woe is me I am one whose cowpen has been torn down I am one whose cows have been scattered 
I am Ningal on whose ewes the weapon has fallen as in the case of an unworthy herdsman 
Woe is me I have been exiled from the city I can find no rest 
I am Ningal I have been exiled from the house I can find no dwelling place 
I am sitting as if a stranger with head high in a strange city 
Debtslaves  bitterness  
I am one who sitting in a debtors prison among its inmates can make no extravagant claims 
In that place I approached him for the sake of his city  I weep bitterly 
I approached the lord for the sake of his house  I weep bitterly 
I approached him for the sake of his destroyed house  I weep bitterly 
I approached him for the sake of his destroyed city  I weep bitterly 
Woe is me I shall say Fate of my city bitter is the fate of my city 
I the queen shall say O my destroyed house bitter is the fate of my house 
O my brickbuilt Ur which has been flooded which has been washed away 
O my good house my city which has been reduced to ruin mounds 
in the debris of your destroyed righteous house I shall lie down alongside you 
Like a fallen bull I will never rise up from your wall  
Woe is me untrustworthy was your building and bitter your destruction 
I am the woman at whose shrine Ur the food offerings have been terminated 
O my Agrunkug the allnew house whose charms never sated me 
O my city no longer regarded as having been built  devastated for what reason 
O my house both destroyed and devastated  devastated for what reason 
Nobody at all escaped the force of the storm ordered in hate 
O my house of Suen in Ur bitter was its destruction

O queen how is your heart  How you have become 
O Ningal how is your heart  How you have become 
O good woman whose city has been destroyed now how do you exist 
O Ningal whose Land has perished how is your heart  
After your city has been destroyed now how do you exist 
After your house has been destroyed how is your heart  
Your city has become a strange city now how do you exist 
Your house has turned to tears how is your heart  
You are not a bird of your city which has been reduced to ruin mounds 
You cannot live there as a resident in your good house given over to the pickaxe 
You cannot act as queen of a people led off to slaughter 
Your tears have become strange tears your Land no longer weeps 
With no lamentation prayers it dwells in foreign lands 
Your Land like  
Your city has been made into ruins now how do you exist 
Your house has been laid bare how is your heart  
Ur the shrine is haunted by the breezes now how do you exist 
Its gudu4 priest no longer walks in his wig how is your heart  
Its en priestess no longer lives in the gipar now how do you exist 
In the uzga shrine the priest who cherishes purification rites makes no purification rites for you 
Father Nanna your iib priest does not make perfect holy supplications to you 
Your luma priest does not dress in linen in your holy giguna shrine 
Your righteous en priestess chosen in your ardent heart she of the Ekinugal 
does not proceed joyously from the shrine to the gipar 
The aua priests do not celebrate the festivals in your house of festivals 
They do not play for you the em and ala instruments which gladden the heart nor the tigi 
The blackheaded people do not bathe during your festivals 
Like  mourning has been decreed for them their appearance has indeed changed 
Your song has been turned into weeping before you  how long will this last 
Your tigi music has been turned into lamentation before you  how long will this last 
Your bull is not brought into its pen its fat is not prepared for you 
Your sheep does not live in its fold its milk is not made abundant for you 
Your fat carrier does not come to you from the cowpen  how long will this last 
Your milk carrier does not come to you from the sheepfold  how long will this last 
An evildoer has seized your fisherman who was carrying fish  how long will this last 
Lightning carried off your fowler who was carrying birds  how long will this last 
The teme plants grow in the middle of your watercourses which were once suitable for barges 
and mountain thornbushes grow on your roads which had been constructed for waggons 
My queen your city weeps before you as its mother 
Ur like a child lost in a street seeks a place before you 
Your house like a man who has lost everything stretches out  its hands to you 
Your brickbuilt righteous house like a human being cries Where are you 
My queen you have indeed left the house you have left the city 
How long will you stand aside from your city like an enemy 
Mother Ningal you confronted your city like an enemy 
Although you are a queen who loves her city you abandoned your sheepfold 
Although you are one who cares for her Land you set it on fire 
Mother Ningal return like a bull to your cattlepen like a sheep to your fold 
like a bull to your cattlepen of former days like a sheep to your fold 
My queen like a young child to your room return to your house 
May An king of the gods declare Enough to you 
May Enlil king of all the lands decree your fate 
May he restore your city for you  exercise its queenship 
May he restore Nibru for you  exercise its queenship 
May he restore Ur for you  exercise its queenship 
May he restore Isin for you  exercise its queenship

Alas storm after storm swept the Land together 
the great storm of heaven the everroaring storm 
the malicious storm which swept over the Land 
the storm which destroyed cities the storm which destroyed houses 
the storm which destroyed cowpens the storm which burned sheepfolds 
which laid hands on the holy rites 
 which defiled the weighty counsel 
the storm which cut off all that is good from the Land 
the storm which pinioned the arms of the blackheaded people

the storm which caused the wife to be abandoned which caused the child to be abandoned 
the storm which caused the light in the Land to disappear 
the storm which swept through ordered in hate by Enlil  
Father Nanna may that storm swoop down no more on your city 
May your blackheaded people see it no more 
May that storm like rain pouring down from heaven never recur 
May that storm which struck down all the blackheaded living beings of heaven and earth 
be entirely destroyed 
May the door be closed on it like the great citygate at nighttime 
May that storm not be given a place in the reckoning 
may its record be hung from a nail outside the house of Enlil

From distant days when the Land was founded 
O Nanna the humble people who lay hold of your feet 
have brought to you their tears for the silent house playing music before you 
May the blackheaded people cast away from you make obeisance to you 
In your city reduced to ruin mounds may a lament be made to you 
O Nanna may your restored city be resplendent before you 
Like a bright heavenly star may it not be destroyed may it pass before you 
The personal deity of a man brings you a greeting gift 
a supplicant utters prayers to you 
Nanna you who have mercy on the Land 
Lord Aimbabbar  as concerns him who speaks your hearts desire 
Nanna after you have absolved that mans sin 
may your heart relent towards him who utters prayers to you 
3 mss add 1 line The personal deity of this man brings you a present 
He looks favourably on the man who stands there with his offering 
Nanna you whose penetrating gaze searches hearts 
may its people who suffered that evil storm be pure before you 
May the hearts of your people who dwell in the Land be pure before you 
Nanna in your restored city may you be fittingly praised

To overturn the appointed times to obliterate the divine plans 
the storms gather to strike like a flood 
To overturn the divine powers of Sumer 
to lock up the favourable reign in its home 
to destroy the city 
to destroy the house to destroy the cattlepen 
that the cattle should not stand in the pen 
that the sheep should not multiply in the fold 
that watercourses should carry brackish water 
that weeds should grow in the fertile fields 
that mourning plants should grow in the open country 
that the mother should not seek out her child 
that the father should not say O my dear wife 
that the junior wife should take no joy in his embrace 
that the young child should not grow vigorous on his knee 
that the wetnurse should not sing lullabies 
to change the location of kingship 
to defile the seeking of oracles 
to take kingship away from the Land 
to cast the eye of the storm on all the land 
to obliterate the divine plans by the order of An and Enlil 
after An had frowned upon all the lands 
after Enlil had looked favourably on an enemy land 
after Nintur had scattered the creatures that she had created 
after Enki had altered the course of the Tigris and Euphrates 
after Utu had cast his curse on the roads and highways 
so as to obliterate the divine powers of Sumer to change its preordained plans 
to alienate the divine powers of the reign of kingship of Ur 
to humiliate the princely son in his house Ekinugal 
to break up the unity of the people of Nanna numerous as ewes 
to change the food offerings of Ur the shrine of magnificent food offerings 
that its people should no longer dwell in their quarters that they should be given over to live in an inimical place 
that imaki and Elam the enemy should dwell in their place 
that its shepherd in his own palace should be captured by the enemy 
that IbbiSuen should be taken to the land Elam in fetters 
that from Mount Zabu on the edge of the sea to the borders of Anan 
like a swallow that has flown from its house he should never return to his city 
that on the two parallel banks of the Tigris and of the Euphrates bad weeds should grow 
that no one should set out on the road that no one should seek out the highway 
that the city and its settled surroundings should be razed to ruinmounds 
that its numerous blackheaded people should be slaughtered 
that the hoe should not attack the fertile fields that seed should not be planted in the ground 
that the melody of the cowherds songs should not resound in the open country 
that butter and cheese should not be made in the cattlepen that dung should not be stacked on the ground 
that the shepherd should not enclose the sacred sheepfold with a fence 
that the song of the churning should not resound in the sheepfold 
to decimate the animals of the open country to finish off all living things 
that the fourlegged creatures of akkan should lay no more dung on the ground 
that the marshes should be so dry as to be full of cracks and have no new seed 
that sicklyheaded reeds should grow in the reedbeds and come to an end in a stinking morass 
that there should be no new growth in the orchards that it should all collapse by itself 
Ur the great charging wild bull confident in its own strength 
the primeval city of lordship and kingship built on sacred ground  
 so as quickly to subdue it like a roped ox to bow its neck to the ground 
An Enlil Enki and Ninursaga have decided this as its fate 
Its fate cannot be changed Who can overturn it 
It is the command of An and Enlil Who can oppose it 
An frightened the very dwellings of Sumer the people were afraid 
Enlil blew an evil storm silence lay upon the city 
Nintur bolted the door of the storehouses of the Land 
Enki blocked the water in the Tigris and the Euphrates 
Utu took away the pronouncement of equity and justice 
inanna handed over victory in strife and battle to a rebellious land 
Ningirsu poured Sumer away like milk to the dogs 
Turmoil descended upon the Land something that no one had ever known 
something unseen which had no name something that could not be fathomed 
The lands were confused in their fear 
The god of the city turned away its shepherd vanished 
The people in their fear breathed only with difficulty 
The storm immobilised them the storm did not let them return 
There was no return for them the storm did not retreat 
This is what Enlil the shepherd of the blackheaded people did 
Enlil to destroy the loyal households to decimate the loyal men 
to put the evil eye on the sons of the loyal men on the firstborn 
Enlil then sent down Gutium from the mountains 
Their advance was as the flood of Enlil that cannot be withstood 
The great wind of the countryside filled the countryside it advanced before them 
The extensive countryside was destroyed no one moved about there 
The dark time was roasted by hailstones and flames 
The bright time was wiped out by a shadow 
2 mss add 2 lines In the darkness noses were heaped up heads were smashed 
The storm was a harrow coming from above the city was struck by a hoe 
On that day heaven rumbled the earth trembled the storm worked without respite 
Heaven was darkened it was covered by a shadow the mountains roared 
Utu lay down at the horizon dust passed over the mountains 
Nanna lay at the zenith the people were afraid 
The citys god left his dwelling and stood aside 
The foreigners in the city even chased away its dead 
Large trees were uprooted the forest growth was ripped out 
The orchards were stripped of their fruit they were cleaned of their offshoots 
The crop drowned while it was still on the stalk 
They piled  up in heaps they spread  out like sheaves 
They piled  up in heaps they spread  out like sheaves 
They piled  up in heaps they spread  out like sheaves 
They piled  up in heaps they spread  out like sheaves 
There were corpses floating in the Euphrates weapons smashed heads 
The father turned away from his wife saying This is not my wife 
The mother turned away from her child saying This is not my child 
He who had a productive estate neglected his estate saying This is not my estate 
The rich man took an unfamiliar path away from his possessions 
In those days the kingship of the Land was defiled 
The tiara and crown that had been on the kings head were both spoiled 
The lands that had followed the same path were split into disunity 
The food offerings of Ur the shrine of magnificent food offerings were changed for the worse 
Nanna traded away his people numerous as ewes 
Its king sat immobilised in his own palace 
IbbiSuen was sitting in anguish in his own palace 
In Enamtila his place of delight he wept bitterly 
The flood dashing a hoe on the ground was levelling everything 
Like a great storm it roared over the earth  who could escape it 
To destroy the city to destroy the house 
so that traitors would lie on top of loyal men 
and the blood of traitors flow upon loyal men

The Gutians the vandals are wiping us out 
We turned to Father Enki in the abzu of Eridug 
 whatever we shall say whatever we shall add

The Tidnum daily strapped the mace to their loins

In Ur no one went to fetch food no one went to fetch water 
Its people rushed around like water being poured from a well 
Their strength ebbed away they could not even go on their way 
Enlil afflicted the city with an evil famine 
He afflicted the city with that which destroys cities that which destroys houses 
He afflicted the city with that which cannot be withstood with weapons 
He afflicted the city with dissatisfaction and treachery 
In Ur which was like a solitary reed there was not even fear 
Its people like fish being grabbed in a pond sought to escape 
Its young and old lay spread about no one could rise 
At the royal station  there was no food on top of the platform  
The king who used to eat marvellous food grabbed at a mere ration 
As the day grew dark the eye of the sun was eclipsing the people experienced hunger 
There was no beer in the beerhall there was no more malt for it 
There was no food for him in his palace it was unsuitable to live in 
Grain did not fill his lofty storehouse he could not save his life 
The grainpiles and granaries of Nanna held no grain 
The evening meal in the great dining hall of the gods was defiled 
Wine and syrup ceased to flow in the great dining hall 
The butchers knife that used to slay oxen and sheep lay hungry 
Its mighty oven no longer cooked oxen and sheep it no longer emitted the aroma of roasting meat 
The sounds of the bursag building the pure  of Nanna were stilled 
The house which used to bellow like a bull was silenced 
Its holy deliveries were no longer fulfilled its  were alienated 
The mortar pestle and grinding stone lay idle no one bent down over them 
The Shining Quay of Nanna was silted up 
The sound of water against the boats prow ceased there was no rejoicing 
Dust piled up in the unuribanda of Nanna 
The rushes grew the rushes grew the mourning reeds grew 
Boats and barges ceased docking at the Shining Quay 
Nothing moved on your watercourse which was fit for barges 
The plans of the festivals at the place of the divine rituals were altered 
The boat with firstfruit offerings of the father who begot Nanna no longer brought firstfruit offerings 
Its food offerings could not be taken to Enlil in Nibru 
Its watercourse was empty barges could not travel 
There were no paths on either of its banks long grass grew there 
The reed fence of the wellstocked cattlepen of Nanna was split open 
The gardens fence was vioilated and breached 
The cows and their young were captured and carried off to enemy territory 
The munzerfed cows took an unfamiliar path in an open country that they did not know 
Gayau who loves cows dropped his weapon in the dung 
unidug who stores butter and cheese did not store butter and cheese 
Those who are unfamiliar with butter were churning the butter 
Those who are unfamiliar with milk were curdling  the milk 
The sound of the churning vat did not resound in the cattlepen 
Like mighty coals that once burnt its smoke is extinguished 
The great dining hall of Nanna  
Suen wept to his father Enlil 
O father who begot me why have you turned away from my city which was built  for you 
O Enlil why have you turned away from my Ur which was built  for you 
The boat with firstfruit offerings no longer brings firstfruit offerings to the father who begot him 
Your food offerings can no longer be brought to Enlil in Nibru 
The en priests of the countryside and city have been carried off by phantoms 
Ur like a city raked by a hoe is to be counted as a ruinmound 
The Duur Enlils restingplace has become a haunted shrine 
O Enlil gaze upon your city an empty wasteland 
Gaze upon your city Nibru an empty wasteland 
The dogs of Ur no longer sniff at the base of the city wall 
The man who used to drill large wells scratches the ground in the market place 
My father who begot me enclose in your embrace my city which is all alone 
Enlil return to your embrace my Ur which is all alone 
Enclose in your embrace my Ekinugal which is all alone 
May you bring forth offspring in Ur may you multiply its people 
May you restore the divine powers of Sumer that have been forgotten

Enlil then answered his son Suen 
There is lamentation in the haunted city reeds of mourning grow there 
1 ms adds 1 line In its midst there is lamentation reeds of mourning grow there 
In its midst the people pass their days in sighing 
1 ms adds 1 line My son the noble son  why do you concern yourself with crying 
Oh Nanna the noble son  why do you concern yourself with crying 
The judgment uttered by the assembly cannot be reversed 
The word of An and Enlil knows no overturning 
Ur was indeed given kingship but it was not given an eternal reign 
From time immemorial since the Land was founded until people multiplied 
who has ever seen a reign of kingship that would take precedence for ever 
The reign of its kingship had been long indeed but had to exhaust itself 
O my Nanna do not exert yourself in vain abandon your city 
Then my king the noble son became distraught 
Lord Aimbabbar the noble son grieved 
Nanna who loves his city left his city 
Suen took an unfamiliar path away from his beloved Ur 
In order to go as an exile from her city to foreign territory 
Ningal quickly clothed herself and left the city 
The Anuna stepped outside of Ur 
 approached Ur 
The trees of Ur were sick its reeds were sick 
Laments sounded all along its city wall 
Daily there was slaughter before it 
Large axes were sharpened in front of Ur 
The spears the arms of battle were prepared 
The large bows throwsticks and shields gathered together to strike 
The barbed arrows covered its outer side like a raining cloud 
Large stones fell toegether with great thuds 
1 ms adds 1 line Daily the evil wind returned in the city 
Ur confident in its own strength stood ready for the murderers 
Its people oppressed by the enemy could not withstand their weapons 
In the city those who had not been felled by weapons succumbed to hunger 
Hunger filled the city like water it would not cease 
This hunger contorted peoples faces twisted their muscles 
Its people were as if drowning in a pond they gasped for breath 
Its king breathed heavily in his own palace 
Its people dropped their weapons their weapons hit the ground 
They struck their necks with their hands and cried 
They sought counsel with each other they searched for clarification 
Alas what can we say about it What more can we add to it 
How long until we are finished off by this catastrophe 
Inside Ur there is death outside it there is death 
Inside it we are to be finished off by famine Outside it we are to be finished off by Elamite weapons 
In Ur the enemy oppresses us oh we are finished 
In Ur the enemy oppresses us oh we are finished 
The people took refuge  behind the city walls They were united in fear 
The palace that was destroyed by onrushing water was defiled its doorbolts were torn out 
Elam like a swelling flood wave left  only the ghosts 
In Ur weapons smashed heads like clay pots 
Its refugees were unable to flee they were trapped inside the walls 
1 ms adds 3 lines Like fish living in a pond they tried to escape 
The enemy seized the Ekinugal of Nanna 
They ripped out its heavy  
The statues that were in the shrine were cut down 
The great stewardess Ninigara ran away from the storehouse 
Its throne was cast down before it she threw herself down into the dust 
Its mighty cows with shining horns were captured their horns were cut off 
Its unblemished oxen and grassfed sheep were slaughtered 
1 ms adds 1 line They were cut down as date palms and were tied together 
The palmtrees strong as mighty copper the heroic strength 
were torn out like rushes were plucked like rushes their trunks were turned sideways 
Their tops lay in the dust there was no one to raise them 
The midribs of their palm fronds were cut off and their tops were burnt off 
Their date spadices that used to fall  on the well were torn out 
The fertile reeds which grew in the sacred  were defiled 
The great tribute that they had collected was hauled off to the mountains 
The houses great door ornament fell down its parapet was destroyed 
The wild animals that were intertwined on its left and right 
lay before it like heroes smitten by heroes 
Its gapingmouthed dragons and its aweinspiring lions 
were pulled down with ropes like captured wild bulls and carried off to enemy territory 
The fragrance of the sacred seat of Nanna formerly like a fragrant cedar grove was destroyed 
1 ms adds 1 line Its architrave  gold and lapis lazuli 
The glory of the house whose glory was once so lovely was extinguished 
Like a storm that fills all the lands it was built there like twilight in the heavens 
its doors adorned with the heavenly stars 
its  Great bronze latches  were torn out 
Its hinges  Together with its door fittings it  wept bitterly like a fugitive 
The bolt the holy lock and the great door were not fastened for it 
The noise of the door being fastened had ceased 
there was no one to fasten it 
The  and was put out in the square 
The food offerings  of his royal dining place were altered 
In its sacred place  the tigi em and ala instruments did not sound 
Its mighty tigi  did not perform its sacred song 
There was no eloquence in the Dublama the place where oaths used to be taken 
The throne was not set up at its place of judgment justice was not administered 
Alamu threw down his sceptre his hands trembling 
In the sacred bedchamber of Nanna musicians no longer played the balag drum 
The sacred box that no one had set eyes upon was seen by the enemy 
The divine bed was not set up it was not spread with clean hay 
The statues that were in the shrine were cut down 
The cook the dream interpreter and the seal keeper did not perform the ceremonies properly 
They stood by submissively and were carried off by the foreigners 
The priests of the holy uzga shrine and the sacred lustrations the linenclad priests 
forsook the divine plans and sacred divine powers they went off to a foreign city 
In his grief Suen approached his father 
He went down on his knee in front of Enlil the father who begot him 
O father who begot me how long will the enemy eye be cast upon my account how long  
he lordship and the kingship that you bestowed  
Father Enlil the one who advises with just words 
the wise words of the Land  
your inimical judgment 
look into your darkened heart terrifying like waves 
O Father Enlil the fate that you have decreed cannot be explained 
as for my hairstyle  of lordship and the diadem with which I was crowned 
 he put on a garment of mourning 
Enlil then provided a favourable response to his son Suen 
My son the city built for you in joy and prosperity was given to you as your reign 
Destroying the city overthrowing its great wall and battlements all this too is part of that reign 
 the black black days of the reign that has been your lot 
As for dwelling in your home the Etemenniguru that was properly built  
 indeed Ur shall be rebuilt in splendour the people shall bow down to you 
There is to be bounty at its base there is to be grain 
There is to be splendour at its top the sun shall rejoice there 
Let an abundance of grain embrace its table 
May Ur the city whose fate was pronounced by An be restored for you 
Having pronounced his blessing Enlil raised his head toward the heavens 
May the land south and highland be organised for Nanna 
May the roads of the mountains be set in order for Suen 
Like a cloud hugging the earth they shall submit to him 
By order of An and Enlil it shall be conferred 
Father Nanna came into his city of Ur with head raised high 
The youth Suen could enter again into the Ekinugal 
Ningal refreshed herself in her sacred living quarters 
1 ms adds 1 line In Ur she could enter again into her Ekinugal 
4th kirugu 
There is lamentation in the haunted city mourning reeds grew there 
In its midst there is lamentation mourning reeds grew there 
Its people spend their days in moaning

Indeed the storm that blew on the land blew on the foreign lands 
It has blown on Tidnum it has blown on the foreign lands 
It has blown on Gutium it has blown on the foreign lands 
It has blown on Anan it has blown on the foreign lands 
It levelled Anan like a blowing evil wind 
Famine has overwhelmed the evildoer those people will have to submit 
May An not change the divine powers of heaven the divine plans for treating the people with justice 
May An not change the decisions and judgments to lead the people properly 
To travel on the roads of the Land may An not change it 
May An and Enlil not change it may An not change it

After the cattle pen had been built for the foremost divine powers  
 how did it become a haunted place When will it be restored 
Where once the brick of fate had been laid  
 who scattered its divine powers The lamentation is reprised 
how did the storeroom of Nibru the shrine Duranki 
become a haunted place When will it be restored 
After Kiur the great place had been built 
after the brickwork of Ekur had been built 
after Ubuukkena had been built 
after the shrine Egalma had been built  
 how did they become haunted When will they be restored 
How did the true city become empty 
Its precious designs have been defiled 
How were the citys festivals neglected 
Its magnificent rites have been thrown into disorder 
In the heart of Nibru where the divine powers were allotted 
and the blackheaded people prolificly multiplied 
the citys heart no longer revealed any sign of intelligence  
 there where the Anuna used to give advice 
In Ubuukkena the place for making great judgments 
they no longer impart decisions or justice 
Where its gods had established their dwellings 
where their daily rations were offered their daises erected 
where the sacred royal offering  and the evening meal in their great banquet hall 
were destined for the pouring out of choice beer and syrup  
 Nibru the city where in its spreading shade 
the blackheaded people used to cool themselves  
 in their dwellings Enlil fell upon them as if they were criminals 
It was he who sent them scattering like a scattered herd of cattle 
The inner city whose bitter tears were overwhelming 
How long until its lady the goddess Ninlil would ask after it 
That great temple whose bustle of activity was famous 
as though it were empty wasteland no one enters it 
As for all the great rulers who increased the wealth of the city of Nibru  why did they disappear 
Where the blackheaded people ate rich grass like sheep 
For how long would Enlil neglect that Land ears lamentation depression and despair 
How long would his spirit burn and his heart not be placated 
Why were those who once played the em and ala drums 
spending their time in bitter lamenting 
Why were the lamenters sitting in its brick buildings 
They were bewailing the hardship which beset them 
The men whose wives had fallen whose children had fallen 
were singing Oh our destroyed city 
Their city gone their homes abandoned  
 as those who were singing for the brick buildings of the good city 
as the lamenters of wailing 
like the fosterchildren of an ecstatic no longer knowing their own intelligence 
the people were smitten their minds thrown into disorder 
The true temple wails bitterly 
1st kirugu 
built the temple Ninlil 
Its gigigal 
The true temple gave you only tears and lamentation  
 it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansingrites that are forgotten 
The brickwork of Ekur gave you only tears and lamentation  
 it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansingrites that are forgotten 
It weeps bitter tears over the splendid rites and most precious plans which are desecrated  
 its most sacred food rations neglected and  into funeral offerings it cries Alas 
The temple despairs of its divine powers utterly cleansed pure hallowed which are now defiled 
The true temple which it is bitter to enter on ones own 
passes the time renewing its tears 
Because the sealings of the abundant materials stored in the temple have been broken open they have placed the loads on the ground 
Because the property in its welltended storehouses has been sent back it says What will they weigh out for me now 
because the enemies who do not know good from evil have cut off all good things it sings a bitter dirge 
because they have finished off its populace there like animals it cries Oh my Land 
Because they have piled up the young women young men and their little children like heaps of grain it cries Woe for them 
Because they have splashed their blood on the ground like a rainstorm there is no restraint to its crying 
The temple like a cow whose calf is cut off groans bitterly to itself 
it is griefstricken and the sweetvoiced lamenters like nursemaids singing a lullaby respond tearfully with its name 
In anguish they bewail the fact that the citys lord has smashed heads there 
that he has looked away from it and toward a foreign land instead 
The true temple of all the countries which had come before him  
the blackheaded people who had taken a true path 
what have they done regarding what have they forsaken 
that their lord has become enraged with them and walks in anger 
2nd kirugu 
It voices bitter cries because he has removed the great divine powers from within it 
Its gigigal 
The citys lord who became angry with it 
How long will he not turn to it not say Alas for it 
Why did he cut off the road to its brickwork 
He made the noisy pigeons fly away from their windows 
Why did he transform the appearance of the temple which knew voices where they used to while away the days in sweet playing of tigi drums in the brick buildings 
The temple once a place to offer salutations in humility 
is now as deathly silent as a temple which no one reveres 
As though its purification priests equipment were not utterly sacred 
as though its cleansingrites did not bring calm in all countries 
he has abandoned it turned his breast away from it 
among dejection and lamentation he has made it a sacrilege 
After its fate how long till his face would be streaked with teardrops 
He rejected it thus as though it were a blasphemy 
Why has joy left its brickwork 
Night and day he has filled its heart with tears 
Even now he has made it foreign and a sacrilege 
Its lord who has despoiled it like an evil wind 
has destroyed that city and its temples 
He has ripped out their foundations struck them with the adze 
killed wives and their children within it 
he has turned that city into a deserted city  
 when would he restore its ancient property 
Its possessions have been carried off by the wind 
Enlil turned the city which used to be there into a city no longer 
He made its mind wander 
He threw its intelligence into disorder and made it haunted 
He took away its food and its water 
He brought to an end its days of familiarity with milk and with beer 
The temple which he has made a sacrilege utters bitter lamentations 
he has made its eyes blurred with tears 
The lamenters who perform the dirges 
respond to it sorrowfully 
The citys lord who has removed its divine powers  
no one touches his arm no one intercedes 
3rd kirugu 
How did Enlil make all his greatest divine powers fly away 
No one ever touches his arm No one ever intercedes 
Its gigigal 
To my dirge singer of bitter fates 
I am going down and I shall weep tearfully to him 
Even now the lamenters who are expert in song 
make ululating wails over me 
Now my people who are overcome by hardship 
voice laments for me one by one 
Even now the places of refuge of my people whose hearts are burning in dark distress 
have been made known to me 
My people whose hearts have been broken on the bitter way 
perform the lullabies of my young ones for me in tears 
The wellbuilt houses ladies dwellings 
were falsely founded and they have been eroded by the winds 
Of how the foe has finished off my Land 
They are making a lament 
They are addressing the cries of my heart overwhelmed with bitterness in order to soothe it 
They are beginning their laments about my lord 
He will have mercy and compassion on me  
Enlil father of the blackheaded people 
he who will give the order to restore me 
4th kirugu 
My heart is dark I am destroyed I am in chaos I have been devastated 
Its gigigal 
In the foremost brick buildings they sing that your fate is bitter 
Even now to Enlil who will accept your tears for you 
weeping bitter tears of your own accord 
speak supplications to your lord himself concerning what he did to you concerning that fate 
My lord how long Look upon me with favour my lord 
Say Why  
Say May your heart be soothed for me  overturn this sacrilege for your own good The day is  
Say Reenter for me your dwelling in my darkened shrines 
Say Like a bright cleansed sacred day give  for your own good 
Say  
Say Your misfortunes  will rebuild it 
Perhaps by this means I can make him have compassion and mercy for you 
Depression has weakened your heart but I am the one who has established good cheer for you 
He will fix it forever as your lot that you shall lift your head high 
he will make good again the hostilities he is directing against you 
5th kirugu 
In the city which does not know freedom he struck them down thus 
Its gigigal 
Even now your lord has smitten the enemy fury for you 
He has had mercy on you and decreed your fate 
He has said Enough so that he has removed lamentation from your brick buildings 
In good mood and with a joyful heart he has entered in there again for you 
Ninurta the mighty commissioner has looked after things 
He stood there before the hero 
his provider ImeDagan and issued the command to him to completely rebuild the Ekur the most precious shrine 
He has restored its ancient property 
to restore its ziggurat temple to make it shine like the day 
to make fitting the dais upon its platform 
He has put back in their place the rites which the enemy disordered and desecrated 
along with the scattered divine powers 
The cleansingrites which the enemy had put a stop to 
so that they should sanctify and purify again 
he has given him his sacred unchangeable decision 
He has told ImeDagan his beloved shepherd 
that faultless bulls and faultless bucks should be slaughtered 
When decrees the fate of the sacred royal offering place  he will offer salutations 
and stand there daily in supplication and prayer 
Your bitter tears 
Your bitter tears 
6th kirugu 
How long before you will rest at ease 
Its gigigal 
How long will the brickwork strain its eyes upwards in tears and lamentations 
Even now your lord the Great Mountain Enlil supreme in the universe 
has removed lamentation from your brick buildings and made favourable your humour 
Now city your lord who has had compassion and mercy for you 
Father Enlil lord of all countries who has commanded that you be restored 
and the great mother Ninlil who entreated him in prayer there 
and the brickwork itself which said to him Steady the trembling of Nibru 
and said to him Rebuild my womens quarters for me Reestablish my temples for me  
 he who mulled things over so that he came to a decision about them 
Enlil who found agreeable his command of true words 
who beneficently entered the true temple which had suffered destruction  
 he himself is removing what he turned upon you in distress 
Just as he silenced you when he made joy enter again 
he decreed as your fate the sound of choice beer and syrup being poured out to overflowing 
Enough It is time to stifle the lament he said to you himself 
Because you have been living in a state of neglect Enlil who has decreed your fate 
has said My city you have placated my sacred heart towards you He has returned to you 
Nibru you have placated my sacred heart towards you He has returned to you 
True city he has decreed your great fate and made your reign long 
Nibru he has decreed your great fate and made your reign long 
Enlil himself has commanded ImeDagan that the Ekur should shine like the day 
Steady sunlight shines into the Kiur he has brought daylight in there again for you 
Ninlil has decreed your fate in the agiua 
Enlil and Ninlil together founded daises in the Ekur 
They dined there and enjoyed choice beer 
They deliberated how to make the blackheaded people secure in their dwellings 
They have brought back to you the people who had been completely devastated 
They have gathered back together the children whom they turned away from their mothers 
The populace goes with you in their strongholds 
Shrine Nibru the Great Mountain Enlil has returned to you 
7th kirugu 
How you suffer How depression exhausts you 
Its gigigal 
Even now they command ImeDagan that Sumer and Akkad should be restored at your feet 
that their scattered people should be returned to their nests 
They have brought the news that the magnificent rites of Eridug would not be forgotten 
its heart sending forth wisdom so that good sense should be allotted 
Adab the city whose lady fashions living things who promotes birthing 
The Anuna the lords who decree fates order that it should be rebuilt 
Ur founded in a pasture its divine powers distinct from the rest 
An and Enlil have advised that it should be restored 
The prince of the city Larsam the herald of the universe the judge of the numerous people 
They command him to secure its foundations to follow the proper path 
UrukKulaba the sacred city the handiwork of the gods 
They have taken a decision concerning it and restored it 
from the region of zabala the city where the mistress of heaven concentrated her forces 
they have brought news of the removal of all foes and enemies 
On Laga the mooringpole of heaven and the shrine irsu established long ago 
An and Enlil have looked with their beneficent gaze 
From that temple in Umma egkuraga which had been ill treated 
they have removed the treacherous Tidnum 
Ki at the edge of Sumer and Akkad its dominion superlative 
It is the great gods who have commanded that its foundations should be secured 
Marda the city in whose river water flows in whose fields is fine grain  
 the Anuna who took those things away from it returned them to it again 
Isin the provisioner of the Anuna rising high since times of old  
 An Enlil Enki and Ninma have made its reign long 
By their command they have handed it over and expressed their approval 
They have entrusted it to Ninurta the champion the strong hero 
Ninisina the exalted child of An the incantation priest of the Land

Damu the chief barber of Nunamnir healer of the living

8th kirugu 
An Enlil Enki and Ninma have given their orders

Now see Enlil has fixed a good day in the land 
He has even now ordered the day for Nibru to raise its neck to heaven 
He himself has provided a good day for the Ekur to shine 
He himself has raised up the day for the Kiurs magnificent manifestation 
He himself has restored the day for Sumer and Akkad to expand 
He himself has set aside the day for houses to be built and storerooms to be enclosed 
He himself has brought out the day for seeds to sprout and living things to be born 
He has brought out the day for building cattle pens and founding sheepfolds 
he ewes which bore lambs have filled the pens 
Ewes have given birth in the folds their lambs have filled the pens 
The goats which bore kids have filled the folds 
The ewes which flocked with their lambs have swelled the sheepfold 
The goats which flocked with their kids have caused the pens to be widened 
He himself has set the day for turning destruction to the good 
He has  the day  evil 
He has brought in ImeDagan as assistance for the day for establishing justice in the land 
9th kirugu 
Although Sumer and Akkad had been desecrated by the foe 
afterwards hearts were appeased spirits soothed 
All the great gods thus had compassion 
They looked upon those sunk in exhaustion and brought them up out of it 
They restored your city which had been razed to ruins 
Its shining property which had been scattered which had been devastated 
Enlil king of all countries restored it 
There where the populace rested in the cool after building their nests 
in Nibru the mountain of the greatest divine powers from where they had taken an unfamiliar path  
at Enlils word the Anuna those very lords who determine the fates ordered that the temples which they had forsaken 
and the jewels put there long ago which had been carried off by the wind 
should all be restored 
He has established there dining in joy within 
To ImeDagan his joyous reverent sacral officiant 
to sanctify its food to purify its water Enlil has given the command to him 
He has commanded him to purify its defiled divine powers 
He has put in order its disordered and scattered rites 
he has put back in their place the most sacred things neglected and defiled 
He decrees as a fate the offering of daily rations and the grinding up of fine meal and flour 
He has decided to make bread plentiful on the table to make loaves numerous

a time when darkness is to be lifted in the Land so that living things should rejoice 
Father Enlil the lord whose command cannot be altered prince of all countries 
has fixed it among the blackheaded people and commanded for their benefit 
11th kirugu 
Now see After that time Enlil the prince who is full of pity 
has been beneficent to his hero who had laid the  brick 
He put in order again for him the divine powers which had been desecrated by the enemy 
He sanctified again the defiled rites for him 
He purified its ziggurat temple and made it resplendent for him 
Within he made abundance plentiful he filled it with choice beer and syrup 
He established there at that time the pleasing of hearts the appeasing of spirits the ameliorating of moods 
ImeDagan himself stood in prayer to Enlil and offered salutations 
When he had begun the lament and spoken the supplication 
the prince of all countries treated his body with oil of abundance as if it were the sweetest syrup 
And his prayer was heard  Enlil looked upon him with favour 
ImeDagan whose words bring Enlil pleasure 
Enlils constant attendant with whose thoughts he agrees 
Because the humble one prostrated himself in his devotions and served there 
because he will entreat him in supplication and will do obeisance 
because he will complete and honour the royal offering and will return 
because he will keep watch over everything and will not be negligent 
Enlil has promised to ImeDagan his dominion of extended years 
He promised him that he will be a man of preeminent kingship 
He promised him that he will be a king whose reign is good 
He promised him that he shall have the people inhabit safe dwellings 
Enlil found agreement in what he had said to the numerous people 
On the day for decreeing fates every part of Sumer and Akkad 
mong the blackheaded people flocking like sheep among their welltended people 
will praise forever the majesty of the Great Mountain Nunamnir enkar weapon of the universe 
It is his aweinspiring way 
12th kirugu 
The  which had developed  its wiping clean  was to be accomplished  
The  of heaven and earth put their divine powers  to sleep  
 mortal man multiplied to become as numerous as the gods 
 mortal man multiplied to become as numerous as the gods 
When together  had achieved a momentous decision 
 the  of the gods  
Enki and Ninki determined the consensus  
Enul and Ninul assigned the fate  
When together An and Enlil had created it that one resembled  
When Ninlil had given it features that one was fit for  
When together Aruru Suen and Enki had fashioned its limbs 
that one turned pitch black as at night halfway through the watch  
All the great gods paled at its immensity and  was brought about 
Like a great wild bull which bellows mightily that one filled the world with its roar 
As its gigantic horns reached up to heaven who trembled in his very core 
As it was piled up over the mountains like a battlenet who turned away 
Who caused wailing and lamenting in those streets and  
Uruk like a loyal citizen in terror set up an alarm 
and exclaimed Rise up Why did its hand seize Uruk Why did the benevolent eye look away 
Who brought about such worry and lamenting and  
That one drew nearer That one settled upon the ground Why would he withdraw 
Who distorted Uruks good sense and deranged its good counsel 
Who smashed its good udug deity Who struck its good lamma deity too 
Who desecrated the fearsome radiance which crowned it 
Who brought about mob panic in Uruk Who  sickness too 
Along with the city the foreign lands  who  in the temple of Uruk 
That one  
Who made  
Who made  
Why was  expanded Who made the blackheaded people become so numerous 
Who overthrew  
 was destroyed  who restored  
Who confronted  
That one crushed  
That one  
 like  
 and Utu who in human form renders judgment at the law court of heaven set and did not rise again 
 bore a heavy burden of sin 
 the altered verdicts of Lord Nunamnir 
who can smite  
 and they approach  
 he brings  forth

He  and puts an end to  
 each and every one  
 each and every one  
 its ways were  
its destruction and demolition  
The  of the gods  attention 
 who neglected  
 the city watched as the evil ghost approached 
 breathed painfully he wept bitterly 
 there was no nodding of the head 
He consoled himself with tears and laments  the city trembled 
A defiled hand smote him and flattened his skull  the city collapsed 
The fearsome radiance overwhelmed like  
The proud city of all the lands became like one who spreads havoc 
The faithful cowherds themselves overturned every single cattlepen 
The chief shepherds themselves burned  every sheepfold 
They built them up like grain heaps they spread them out like grain piles 
they were convulsed  they drenched the fields with water they turned the city into a swamp 
They did all that Like reeds in a wasteland life could not be revived 
They brought ruination Evil things menaced  the city 
A hush settled over the awed hearts of its people like a cloak 
Its good udug deities went away its lamma deities ran off 
Its lamma deity said Hide in the open country and they took foreign paths 
The citys patron god turned against it and its shepherd abandoned it 
Its guardian spirit though not an enemy was exiled  to a foreign place 
Thus all its most important gods evacuated Uruk they kept away from it 
They hid out in the hills and wandered  about in the haunted plains 
In the city built upon peace food and drink were overturned like a saman vessel 
In the pasture lands a tumultuous noise arose the asses and sheep were driven away 
Elderly people and babies taking their rest  in front  
They saw  and slaughtered   
He  and opened his clenched fist 
He  and opened his clenched fist 
He  and opened his clenched fist 
He  and opened his clenched fist 
He  and reached out his hand 
The  of Sumer the city whose king crossed over to an enemy land

Its overgrown hair shall be a harrow its back shall be flames 
Its countenance shall be a malevolent storm that enshrouds heaven and earth 
The glint of its eyes shall be lightning that flashes far like the Anzud bird 
Its mouth shall rage  a blazing fire that extends as far as the nether world 
Its tongue shall be an inferno raining embers that sunders the Land 
Its arms shall be the majestic Anzud bird that nothing can escape when it spreads wide its talons 
Its ribs shall be crowbars that let light pass inside like the suns rays 
Knotted at both its hips shall be citydestroying slingstones 
Its great haunches shall be dripping knives covered with gore that make blood flow 
Its muscles shall be saws that slash its feet those of an eagle 
It shall make the Tigris and Euphrates quaver it shall make the mountains rumble 
At its reverberation the hills shall be uprooted the people shall be pitched about like sheaves 
Sumer and Akkad shall shiver they shall be flooded like a harvest crop 
The foolish shall rejoice they shall exclaim  
Let it come  we shall be seeing war and battle in the city 
how the sacred precinct  is destroyed how the walls are battered down how the citys peace is disrupted 
how among the loyal families honest men are transformed into traitors 
But the sensible shall beat their breasts and droop  their heads 
At midnight they shall be afraid and tearful and suffer insomnia 
In bed under the covers they shall be unable to sleep soundly they shall wander about the city 
They shall be immobilised their courage shall run out 
May our allies serving in times of war raise their forces for peace 
May the word of Enlil be sent back may it turn tail 
May the venom of Nunamnirs anger become exhausted 
May those vicious men who have seized the Ekur be punished 
May those who have set their sight upon Nibru be swept away

Because of the king the chariots were covered over the roads were thrown into disorder no one could go up and down on them 
ecause of UrNamma the chariots were covered over the roads were thrown into disorder no one could go up and down on them 
He presented gifts to the seven chief porters of the nether world 
As the famous kings who had died

As they announced UrNammas coming to the people a tumult arose in the nether world

UrNamma seated the people at a huge banquet 
The food of the nether world is bitter the water of the nether world is brackish

that he could no longer bring pleasure to his wife with his embrace 
that he could not bring up his sons on his knees 
that he would never see in their prime the beauty of their little sisters who had not yet grown up  
 my kings heart was full of tears he  bitterly 
The trustworthy shepherd  a heartrending lament for himself 
I who have been treated like this 
served the gods well set up chapels for them 
I have created evident abundance for the Anuna gods 
I have laid treasures on their beds strewn with fresh herbs 
Yet no god stood by me and soothed my heart 
Because of them anything that could have been a favourable portent for me was as far away from me as the heavens 
the  What is my reward for my eagerness to serve during the days 
My days have been finished for serving them sleeplessly during the night 
Now just as the rain pouring down from heaven cannot turn back 
alas nor can I turn back to brickbuilt Ur 
Alas my wife has become a widow  
She spends the days in tears and bitter laments 
My strength has ebbed away  
The hand of the fate demon  bitterly me the hero 
Like a cow  
Like a wild bull  
Like an offshoot  
Like an ass  I died 
 my  wife  
She spends the days in tears and bitter laments 
Her kind protective god has left her 
her kind protective goddess does not care for her any more 
Ninsumun no longer rests her august arm firmly on her head 
Nanna Lord Aimbabbar no longer leads  her by the hand 
Enki the lord of Eridug does not  
Her  has been silenced  she can no longer answer 
She is cast adrift like a boat in a raging storm the mooring pole has not been strong enough for her 
Like a wild ass lured  into a perilous pit she has been treated heavyhandedly 
Like a lion fallen into a pitfall a guard has been set up for her 
Like a dog kept in a cage she is silenced 
Utu  does not pay heed to the cries Oh my king overwhelming her 
My tigi adab flute and zamzam songs have been turned into laments because of me 
The instruments of the house of cantorship have been propped against the wall 
Instead of my throne whose beauty was endless 
I have been made to  in a soilfilled pit 
Instead of my bed the sleeping place whose  was endless 
I have been made to lie down in the open desolate steppe 
My wife and my children are in tears and wailing 
My people whom I used to command  sing like lamentation 
and dirge singers because of her  
While I was so treated foremost inanna the warlike lady was not present at my verdict 
Enlil had sent her as a messenger to all the foreign lands concerning very important matters 
When she had turned her gaze away from there 
inanna humbly entered the shining Ekur 
she  at Enlils fierce brow 
Then Enlil said Great lady of the Eana once someone has bowed down he cannot   any more 
the trustworthy shepherd left Eana you cannot see him any more 
My lady  among the people  
hen inanna the fierce storm the eldest child of Suen  
made the heavens tremble made the earth shake 
inanna destroyed cattlepens devastated sheepfolds saying 
I want to hurl insults at An the king of the gods 
Who can change the matter if Enlil elevates someone 
Who can change the import of the august words uttered by An the king 
If there are divine ordinances imposed on the Land but they are not observed 
there will be no abundance at the godss place of sunrise 
My holy gipar the shrine Eana has been barred up like  a mountain 
If only my shepherd could enter before me in it in his prime  I will not enter it otherwise 
If only my strong one could grow for me like greenery in the desert 
If only he could hold steady for me like a river boat at its calm mooring 
This is how inanna gave vent  to a lament over him 
Lord Ningizida  
UrNamma my  who was killed 
Among tears and laments  
Among tears and laments  
 decreed a fate for UrNamma 
UrNamma  your august name will be called upon 
From the south to the uplands  the holy sceptre

 Lord Ningizida be praised 
My king  
 among tears and laments 
 frowned at  
 frowned at  
 the day was full of sorrow 
 withdrew into his bedchamber and lay down fasting 
The mother wretched  because of her son  
 the mother of the king holy Ninsumun was crying Oh my heart 
That the fate of UrNamma had been overturned 
and that the trustworthy shepherd had been made to pass away 
she was weeping bitterly in the broad square which is otherwise a place of entertainment 
She spent the day in lamentation over the trustworthy shepherd who had been snatched away 
Sweet sleep did not  come to the people whose happiness had come to an end 
As the early flood was filling the canals their canalinspector  
The mottled barley come forth on the arable lands the life of the land  
To the farmer the fertile fields  
Enkimdu the lord of levees and ditches  
 its numerous people

As he himself was going to Ur UrNamma  house 
The proud one lying in the palace UrNamma who  by the troops   
He could not rise any more the wise one of the countries lay down silence  
As he who was the vigour of the Land has fallen the land became demolished like a mountain 
As he a cypress forest was felled the state of the Land became confused 
As he the cedar tree of the Land was uprooted the state of the Land became altered 
Axes  were set against him a boxwood tree in his joyous dwelling place 
His appointed time arrived and he passed away in his prime 
His  pleasing sacrifices were no longer accepted they were treated as dirty  
The Anuna gods did not reach out for his gifts any more 
 did not stand by an It is enough his  days were not prolonged 
there was no more rising up 
UrNamma a broken jar was abandoned at

and set up a dwelling place for him in the nether world 
At the command of Erekigala 
concerning  all the men who fell by weapons 
and all the men who  guilty 
with  Gilgame his beloved brother

After five days 1 days had passed 
lamenting for Sumer overwhelmed my king 
lamenting for Sumer overwhelmed UrNamma 
As he could not complete the wall of Ur 
as he could no longer enjoy the new palace he had built 
as he the shepherd could no longer protect  his household 
as he could no longer bring pleasure to his wife with his embrace 
as he could not bring up his sons on his knees 
as he would never see in their prime the beauty of their little sisters who are yet to grow up 
the trustworthy shepherd uttered a heartrending lament for himself 
I who have experienced who have experienced fear

I have created evident abundance for the Anuna gods 
I have  treasures to their  shining thrones

after I nobly ascended the royal throne I mustered my chariotry and extensive troops 
Inaccessible fortresses round about I conquered As tribute of horses  
from the land Gilzanu I received 
Because horses in hither to me were not continually brought I became angry 
and to the cities arira and algalaus which were under the authority of the guilty rulers I marched 
Those I conquered in the eponymy of Assurnasirpal Their property booty 
possessions and herds I took out and to my city Assur brought
The great  city together with its people

On the mountain range spanning both heaven and earth 
When An fathered the Anuna gods 
Because no one had been able to give birth to or create Anan yet 
Because the flax of the weaving goddess Uttu had not been created along with them 
Because the pegs of the loom had not been set for Uttu 
Because the ewe had not come forth the lamb had not multiplied 
Because the goat had not come forth the kid had not multiplied 
Because the ewe had not given birth to its lamb 
Because the goat had not given birth to its kid 
The names of both EzinaKusu deified grain and lahar deified ewe 
The Anuna the great gods did not know 
The mu barley of the thirtieth day was not present 
The mu barley of the fortieth day was not present 
The mu barley of the fiftieth day was not present 
The small barley the barley of the mountain the barley of the pure settlement was not present 
Wearing of garments was not present 
Uttu was not yet born the crown was not yet raised 
Lord Bridegroom Dumuzi and Kalkal the gatekeeper of the Ekur were not yet born 
Sumuqan had not yet come out in the dry land 
The humans of that distant time 
They did not know that food was to be eaten 
They did not know the wearing of garments 
In the land one wentstood on limbs ie on all fours naked 
Like sheep one ate with grass in its mouth ie ruminated 
They were drinking water in the ditches 
At that time at the place of forming features of the gods 
In their temple on the Holy Mound  was creating lahar and Ezina 
They gathered them into the shrine where the gods ate food 
The abundance of lahar and Anan 
The Anuna gods of the holy mound 
Were eating but none among them were able to be filled 
The milkcream of their holy sheepfold the sweet thing the Anuna gods of the Holy Mound were drinking but none among them were able to be filled 
Humanity  
At that time Enki spoke to Enlil 
Father Enlil both lahar and Ezina 
Becauseafter created them on the Holy Mound 
We shall send them down from the Holy Mound 
This is how both Enki and Enlil spoke in their holy conversation 
They were sending down both lahar and Ezina from the Holy Mound 
They were enclosing lahar in her sheepfold 
They were giving vast vegetation to her 
For Ezina they were putting down a fertile field 
They were giving to her the plow the yoke and its plow team 
After lahar stood in the sheepfold 
After the shepherd furnished her with allure in the sheepfold 
After Ezina stood in the furrow 
She was a beautifulverdant young woman bearing allure 
After she raised her fertile head in the field 
After she was poured upon by the abundance of heaven 
Both lahar and Ezina appeared 
In heaven abundance was there for them 
In the land life force was there for them 
They were properly executing the me of the gods 
They were making things proliferate in the storehouse of the land 
Into the prison founded in the dust 
After they entered abundance was there for them 
The two of them lit their two where they set their feet 
They are the ones who increase things in the house heavily 
Where they stand they are correct where they sit they are appropriate 
They are ones that are pleasant in the heart of An and the heart of Enlil 
The were drinking sweetintoxicating wine 
They were making themselves sweet ie getting drunk with sweetintoxicating beer 
After they drank sweetintoxicating wine

When I was going to the Abzu the princely house 
When I was going to sweet Eridu 
When I was going to the HouseoftheSweetWaters 
When I was going to the HouseofHeaven the house of Enlil 
When I was going to where the firstfruit offerings are brought in daily 
When I was going to where large bowls have been placed outdoors

When I was going to where the righteous man raised his hand 
When I was going to where the lord Enki raised his hand 
When I was going to where Damgalnuna raised her hand 
When I was going to where Asar in the Abzu raised his hand

When I was following the battle 
I am devastation that rose up wickedly 
When I was entering the house of Enlil 
I am a woman who is surpassing the mountain 
Against the mountain ranges I speak angry words 
My husband took his place in front of me 
Against the house against Utu they take part in combat 
Against Utu and Nanna they take part in combat 
Against Sud the one with the water of the holy dish they take part in combat

In those days in those distant days 
in those nights in those remote nights 
in those years in those distant years 
in days of yore when the necessary things had been brought into manifest existence 
in days of yore when the necessary things had been for the first time properly cared for 
when bread had been tasted for the first time in the shrines of the Land 
when the ovens of the Land had been made to work 
when the heavens had been separated from the earth 
when the earth had been delimited from the heavens 
when the fame of mankind had been established

against the king a storm of small hailstones arose 
against Enki a storm of large hailstones arose 
The small ones were light hammers 
the large ones were like stones from catapults  
The keel of Enkis little boat 
as if it were being butted by turtles was trembling 
against the king the waves at the bow of the boat 
like wolves were eating together 
against Enki the waves at the stern of the boat 
like a lion were attacking 
At that time there was a single tree a single alub tree a single tree 
growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates 
being watered by the Euphrates 
The force of the south wind uprooted it and stripped its branches 
and the Euphrates picked it up and carried it away 
A woman respectful of Ans words was walking along 
respectful of Enlils words was walking along 
and took the tree and into Unug 
into Inannas luxuriant garden brought it 
The woman planted the tree not with her hands but with her feet 
The woman planted the tree not with her hands but with her feet planted it

At its roots a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest

Inanna watered it using not her hands but her feet 
When will this be a luxuriant chair on which I can take a seat she said 
When will this be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down she said 
5 years 1 years had gone by 
the tree had grown massive its bark however did not split 
At its roots a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest 
In its branches the Anzu bird settled its young 
In its trunk the phantom maid built herself a dwelling 
the maid who laughs with a joyful heart 
I silver Inanna cried 
In the matter which his sister had told him about 
her brother the warrior Gilgamesh stood by her 
to his waist his  belt of 5 minas weight he strapped 
5 minas were to him as 3 shekels 
His bronze axe used for expeditions 
which weighs 7 talents and 7 minas in his hand he took 
He killed the snake immune to incantations living at its roots 
The Anzu bird living in its branches took up its young and went into the mountains 
The phantom maid living in its trunk left  her dwelling 
and sought refuge in the wilderness 
As for the tree he uprooted it and stripped its branches 
and the sons of his city who went with him 
cut up its branches and bundled them 
He gave it to his sister silver Inanna for her chair 
He gave it to her for her bed 
As for himself from its roots he manufactured his ball  
and from its branches he manufactured his mallet  
He played with the ball  in the broad square never wanting to stop playing it 
and he praised himself in the broad square never wanting to stop praising himself 
The young men of his city were playing with the ball  
For  him who made the team of the widows children  
they lamented O my neck O my hips 
For those that had a mother bread for her son she brought 
for those that had a sister she poured water for her brother 
As the evening came 
he marked the spot where the ball  had been placed 
and he picked up his ball  from in front of him and took it home 
But early in the morning as he  the place marked 
the widows accusation 
and the young girls complaint 
caused his ball  and his mallet  to fall down to the bottom of the nether world 
He could not reach them by  
He tried with his hand but could not reach them 
tried with his foot but could not reach them 
At the gate of Ganzer in front of the nether world he sat down 
Gilgamesh wept crying bitterly 
O my ball  O my mallet  
My ball  I am still not satiated with its charms 
the game with it has not yet palled for me 
If only my ball  waited still in the carpenters house for me 
I would treat the carpenters wife like my own mother 
I would treat the carpenters child like my little sister 
My ball  has fallen down to the nether worldwho will retrieve it for me 
My mallet  has fallen down to Ganzerwho will retrieve it for me 
His servant Enkidu answered 
My king you weep why does your heart worry 
Today I shall retrieve your ball  from the nether world 
I shall retrieve your mallet  from Ganzer 
Gilgamesh answered Enkidu 
If today you are going to go down to the nether world 
let me advise you My instructions should be followed 
Let me talk to you Pay attention to my words 
You should not put on your clean garments 
they would recognise immediately that you are alien 
You should not anoint yourself with fine oil from a bowl 
they would surround you at its scent 
You should not hurl throwsticks in the nether world 
those struck down by the throwsticks would surround you 
You should not not hold a cornelwood stick in your hand 
the spirits would feel insulted by you 
You should not put sandals on your feet 
You should not shout in the nether world 
You should not kiss your beloved wife 
You should not hit your wife even if you are annoyed with her 
You should not kiss your beloved child 
You should not hit your son even if you are annoyed with him 
The outcry aroused would detain you in the nether world 
She who lies there she who lies there 
Ninazus mother who lies there 
her pure shoulders are not covered with a garment 
and no linen is spread over her pure breast 
She has fingers like a pickaxe 
she plucks her hair out like leeks 
Enkidu however did not heed not his masters words 
He put on his clean garments 
and they recognised that he was alien 
He anointed himself with fine oil from a bowl 
and they surrounded him at its scent 
He hurled throwsticks in the nether world 
and those struck down by the throwsticks surrounded him 
He held a cornelwood stick in his hand 
and the spirits felt insulted by him 
He put sandals on his feet 
He caused irritation in the nether world 
He kissed his beloved wife 
and hit his wife when he was annoyed with her 
He kissed his beloved child 
and hit his son when he was annoyed with him 
He aroused an outcry and was detained in the nether world 
The warrior Gilgamesh son of Ninsumun 
directed his steps on his own to Ekur the temple of Enlil 
He cried before Enlil 
Father Enlil my ball  fell down into the nether world my mallet  fell down into Ganzer 
Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him 
Namtar did not seize him the Asag did not seize him but the nether world has seized him 
The udug demon of Nergal who spares nobody did not seize him but the nether world has seized him 
He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood but the nether world has seized him 
Father Enlil did not stand by him in the matter so he went to Eridu 
In Eridu he directed his steps on his own to the temple of Enki 
He cried before Enki 
Father Enki my ball  fell down into the nether world my mallet  fell down into Ganzer 
Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him 
Namtar did not seize him the Asag did not seize him but the nether world has seized him 
The udug demon of Nergal who spares nobody did not seize him but the nether world has seized him 
He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood but the nether world has seized him 
Father Enki stood by him in this matter 
He said to the young warrior Utu the son born by Ningal 
Open a window in the nether world immediately 
and then bring up his servant from the nether world 
He opened a window in the nether world 
and brought up his servant with his breeze  from the nether world 
They hugged and kissed 
They wearied each other with questions 
Did you see the order of the nether world 
If only you would tell me my friend if only you would tell me 
If I tell you the order of the nether world 
si yourself down and weep I shall sit down and weep 
 which your heart rejoiced to touch 
is  
worms infest it like an old garment  
like  of  a crevice it is full of dust 
Alas he said and sat down in the dust 
Did you see him who had 1 son I saw him How does he fare 
He weeps bitterly at the wooden peg which was driven into his wall 
Did you see him who had 2 sons I saw him How does he fare 
He sits on 2 bricks eating bread 
Did you see him who had 3 sons I saw him How does he fare 
He drinks water from a saddle waterskin 
Did you see him who had 4 sons I saw him How does he fare 
His heart rejoices like a man who has four asses to yoke 
Did you see him who had 5 sons I saw him How does he fare 
Like a good scribe he is indefatigable he enters the palace easily 
Did you see him who had 6 sons I saw him How does he fare 
He is a cheerful as a ploughman 
Did you see him who had 7 sons I saw him How does he fare 
As a companion of the gods he sits on a throne and listens to judgments 
Did you see the palace eunuch I saw him How does he fare 
Like a useless alala stick he is propped in a corner 
Did you see the woman who never gave birth I saw her How does she fare 
Like a  pot she is thrown away violently she gives no man joy 
Did you see the young man who never undressed his wife I saw him How does he fare 
You finish a rope and he weeps over the rope 
Did you see the young woman who never undressed her husband I saw her How does she fare 
You finish a reed mat and she weeps over the reed mat 
Did you see him who had no heir I saw him How does he fare 
Like him who  bricks  he eats bread 
 I saw him How does he fare 
Did you see  
Did you see  
Did you see  
Did you see  
Did you see  
Did you see  
Did you see  
His food is set apart his water is set apart he eats the food offered  to him he drinks the water offered  to him 
Did you see him who was eaten by a lion 
He cries bitterly O my hands O my legs 
Did you see him who fell down from the roof 
They cannot  his bones 
Did you see the leprous man 
He twitches like an ox as the worms eat at him 
Did you see him who fell in battle I saw him How does he fare 
His father and mother are not there to hold his head and his wife weeps 
Did you see the spirit of him who has no funerary offerings I saw him How does he fare 
He eats the scraps and the crumbs  tossed out in the street 
Did you see him hit by a ships board How does he fare 
Did you see him hit by a ships board How does he fare 
Did you see him hit by a ships board How does he fare 
Alas my mother the man cries to her 
as he pulls out the ships board  
he  cross beam  crumbs 
Did you see my little stillborn children who never knew existence I saw them How do they fare 
They play at a table of gold and silver laden with honey and ghee 
Did you see him who died  I saw him How does he fare 
He lies on a bed of the gods 
Did you see him who was set on fire I did not see him 
His spirit is not about His smoke went up to the sky

The governors sagga officials 
And the land recorders of the border of the plain 
Were properly conveying the monthly nindaba offerings and the nindaba offerings of the new year 
At the gate of Agade exhaustion was placed 
Holy Inanna did not know how to accept the nindaba offering anymore 
Aslike a citizen the temple to be founded did not satisfy her 
The matterword of the Ekur engendered dazed silence 
Trembling lingered for Inanna in Agade 
In Ulma Inanna was afraid 
She went out from the city into her original place of dwelling 
The young woman as if to abandon that of her womens quarters 
Holy Inanna abandoned the shrine of Agade 
Like a warrior advancing against the weapon 
She imposed battle and combat apart from the city 
She beat the breast for the enemy instead 
It was not before the elapse of five days it was not before the elapse of ten days 
The bindings of the enship the crown of kingship 
He bound his hands towards the Ekur temple 
He bound his hands towards the Ekur temple 
He acted towards the giguna like it was worth a mere thirty gig 
He acted towards the giguna like it was worth a mere thirty gig 
Like a male thief who plunders a city 
He gathered upimposed great ladders for use against the temple 
In order to destroy the Ekur temple like a great boat 
In order to loosen its soil like a mountain mined for precious metal 
As if to cutseparate it like the mountain range of lapis lazuli 
In order bring its neck to the ground like a city that Ikur had poured upon 
Although the temple was not inof the mountain of the cut juniper 
He brought great hazin axes towards it

The gakkul vat the gakkul vat 
The gakkul vat the lamsare vat  
The gakkul vat that puts us in a happy mood 
The lamsare vat that makes the stomach rejoice 
The ugurbala jar glory of the house 
The agub jar filling with beer 
The amam jar that carries the beer from the lamsare vat 
The troughs of bur grass and the pails for kneading the dough 
All the beautiful vessels are ready on their pot stands  
May the stomach of your god be well disposed towards you 
Let the eye of the gakkul vat be our eye  
and let the stomach of the gakkul vat be our heart 
What makes your stomach feel wonderful in itself  
also makes our stomachs feel wonderful in themselves 
We are in a happy mood our stomachs are joyful 
You have poured a libation over the brick of fate 
and you have laid the foundations in peace and prosperity 
now may Ninkasi dwell with you  
She should transfer one to the other beer and wine for you  
Let the pouring of the sweet liquor resound pleasantly for you 
In the troughs of bur grass there is sweet beer  
I will have the cupbearers the boys and the brewers stand by 
As I spin around the lake of drinks 
while feeling wonderful feeling wonderful 
while drinking beer in a blissful mood 
while drinking alcohol and feeling exhilarated 
with joy in the stomach and a contented liver 
my stomach is a heart stomach with joy 
I clothe my contented liver in a garment fit for a queen 
The stomach of Inanna is happy once again

The seal with the inscription of Urdun the merchant has gone lost 
By word of the assembly

No one may hold him liable for anything

Zuzu the headmaster 
Zuzu the headmaster 
Sidu the scribe 
Adlub the steward 
Bansage the lamentationpriest and temple administrator 
Mullia the mayor 
and the herald are the witnesses 
After you speak to my king 
To my ram of the mountain range with beautiful horns 
Horse of the mountain range with claws of an eagle 
Date palm grown in a pure place from which shining dates hang down 
After you repeat to him 
For Abaindasa the overseer of the arrayed troops 
he who by delighting his king pleases the heart of his king 
Your servant thus says 
I am powerful the soldier of my king 
Byof your word I shall be your rider 
When the boat is idle I prepare the oars 
When the water is standing still I can make it flow 
When the wind is still I prepare the grain 
When  I illuminate  
When the water is still I make it flow 
As a scribe I incise a stele 
the words of the army I   
I am able to reproduce the dropped and excised words of the assembly 
the sweet words copies   
But now as if I was planted like a tree in my forest I bend over as one who is dirty 
The one who is near to the royal throne has bound my hands with rope 
In my city I the one who wore a clean garment now wears a dirty garment 
As one who has washed with mud clods I caked dirt to serve as facial makeup 
A dog that has eaten carrion has also retreated 
An uumgal creature that kills has also left behind scraps 
After the reedbed is consumed by fire the ponds remain 
After Utu has consumed ghee has consumed cheese he touches the churn to make it more productive 
I have brought out my lifebreath take hold of my hand 
I am the child of a widow one who has not had anyone to inquire after him 
as for me when will the heart of ulgi my king be returned to its place on my behalf 
May my king inquire after me and restore me to the place of my mother 
To my lord the bull with sparkling eyes a beard of lapislazuli sporting 
speak 
To my golden statue on a favorable day born
to my water buffalo in a holy fold reared in the silverstomach of Inanna chosen
to my lord the trusted one of Inanna repeat 
You are fashioned like the son of An 
your utterances like the words of a god are irrevocable
your utterances like rain pouring from the skies are uncountable 
this is what Ursaga your servant says 
My lord has taken care of me I am a son of Ur 
If my lord agrees
my fathers household let no one carry off 
my fathers household let no one take away 
May my lord know this 
Messenger messenger to my mother 
say 
what monkey says 
Ur is the city resplendent of Nanna 
 In Eridu the city abundant of Enki 
 indeed I behind the door of the house of the Chief Musician am sitting 
Looks are feeding me 
May I not die 
There being no fresh bread there being no fresh beer 
have a courier send some to me 
Its a flood 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly

At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
As I let the divine powers go out of my hand these divine powers returned to the abzu 
As I let the divine plan go out of my hand this divine plan returned to the abzu 
This tablet of destinies returned to the abzu I was stripped of the divine powers 
Ninurta was stunned at these words of the Anzuchick 
Ninmena gave out a wail 
And what about me These divine powers have not fallen into my hand 
I shall not exercise their authority I shall not live  like him in the shrine in the abzu 
Father Enki in the abzu knew what had been said 
The Anzuchick took the hero Ninurta by his hand 
and drew near with him to Enkis place the abzu 
The Anzuchick returned Utaulu to the abzu 
The lord was delighted with the hero 
Father Enki was delighted with the hero Ninurta 
Lord Nudimmud honored him duly 
Hero no god among your brother gods could have acted so 
As for the bird which your mighty weapon captured 
from now to eternity you will keep your foot placed on its neck 
May the great gods give your heroic strength its due 
May your father Enlil do whatever you command 
May Ninmena not fashion your equal  
May no one be as revered as you and no god extend an upraised hand before you 
Monthly may your house  regularly receive tributes in the shrine in the abzu 
May An  proclaim your name in the seat of honor 
The hero secretly was not happy with these promises 
Where he stood he darkened and yellowed like  a floodstorm  
He contemplated great deeds and inwardly he was rebellious 
He uttered a word which has no  
The hero Ninurta set his sights on the whole world 
He told no one and inwardly did not  
The great lord Enki intuitively grasped the substance of the plan 
In the shrine in the abzu he stirred up a dark floodstorm 
By the house the minister Isimud opposed Ninurta 
The hero Ninurta refused to come out 
and raised his hand against the minister Isimud 
Against Ninurta Enki fashioned a turtle from the clay of the abzu 
Against him he stationed the turtle at an opening at the gate of the abzu 
Enki talked to him near the place of the ambush 
and brought him to the place where the turtle was 
The turtle was able to grab Ninurtas tendon from behind 
The hero Ninurta managed to turn back its feet 
Enki as if perplexed said What is this 
He had the turtle scrape the ground with its claws had it dig an evil pit 
The hero Ninurta fell into it with the turtle 
The hero did not know how to get out from  
The turtle kept on gnawing his feet with its claws  
The great lord Enki said to him 
From  you who set your mind to kill me 
 who makes big claims 
I cut down I raise up 
You who set your sights on me like this 
what has your position seized for you how  
Where has your strength fled Where is your heroism 
In the great mountains you caused destruction but how will you get out now 
Ninmena learned of this situation 
She was ripping the clothes from her body she   
My ugplanteater Enki whom shall I send to you 
Men will shake their heads in fear  whom shall I send to you 
That name is not Enki That name is Uguguthatdoesnotpour  
You who are death without mercy whom shall I send to you 
In those remote days when the fates were determined 
in a year when An brought about abundance 
and people broke through the earth like green plants  
then the lord of the abzu King Enki 
Enki the lord who determines the fates 
built up his temple entirely from silver and lapis lazuli 
Its silver and lapis lazuli were the shining daylight 
Into the shrine of the abzu he brought joy 
An artfully made bright crenellation rising out from the abzu 
was erected for Lord Nudimmud 
He built the temple from precious metal decorated it with lapis lazuli 
and covered it abundantly with gold 
In Eridu he built the house on the bank 
Its brickwork makes utterances and gives advice 
Its eaves roar like a bull 
the temple of Enki bellows 
During the night the temple praises its lord and offers its best for him 
Before Lord Enki Isimud the minister praises the temple 
he goes to the temple and speaks to it 
He goes to the brick building and addresses it 
Temple built from precious metal and lapis lazuli 
whose foundation pegs are driven into the abzu 
which has been cared for by the prince in the abzu 
Like the Tigris and the Euphrates it is mighty and aweinspiring  
Joy has been brought into Enkis abzu 
Your lock has no rival 
Your bolt is a fearsome lion 
Your roof beams are the bull of heaven an artfully made bright headgear 
Your reedmats are like lapis lazuli decorating the roofbeams 
Your vault is a wild bull raising its horns 
Your door is a lion who seizes a man 
Your stairway is a lion coming down on a man 
Abzu pure place which fulfils its purpose 
Eengura Your lord has directed his steps towards you 
Enki lord of the abzu 
has embellished your foundation pegs with cornelian 
He has adorned you with  and  lapis lazuli 
The temple of Enki is provisioned with silver wax  
it is a bull obedient to its master 
roaring by itself and giving advice at the same time 
Eengura which Enki has surrounded with a silver reed fence 
In your midst a lofty throne is erected 
your doorjamb is the silver locking bar of heaven 
Abzu pure place place where the fates are determined 
the lord of wisdom Lord Enki 
Enki the lord deciding fates 
Nudimmud the lord of Eridu 
lets nobody look into its midst 
Your abgal priests let their hair down their backs 
Enkis beloved Eridu 
Eengura whose inside is full of abundance 
Abzu life of the Land beloved of Enki 
Temple built on the edge befitting the artful divine powers 
Eridu your shadow extends over the midst of the sea 
Eridu your shadow extends over the midst of the sea Rising sea without a rival 
mighty aweinspiring river which terrifies the Land 
Eengura high citadel  standing firm on the earth 
Temple at the edge of the engur a lion in the midst of the abzu 
lofty temple of Enki which bestows wisdom on the Land 
your cry like that of a mighty rising river 
reaches  King Enki 
To his silver house its goodness he sets 
the lyre the algar instrument the balag drum 
the arar the sabitum and the  miritum instruments offer their best for his silver temple 
The  with a sweet sound 
resounded by themselves 
The silver algar instrument of Enki played for him on his own 
and seven tigi drums resounded 
What Enki says is irrefutable 
 is well established  
This is what Isimud spoke to the brick building 
he praised the Eengura with sweet songs 
As it has been built as it has been built 
as Enki has raised Eridu up 
it is an artfully built mountain which floats on the water 
His shrine  spreads  out into the reedbeds 
In its green orchards laden with fruit 
birds brood 
The suhur carp play among the honeyherbs 
and the esztub carp dart among the small gizi reeds 
When Enki rises the fish rise before him like waves 
He has the abzu stand as a marvel 
as he brings joy into the engur 
Like the sea he is aweinspiring 
like a mighty river he instils fear 
The Euphrates rises before him as it does before the fierce south wind 
His punting pole is Nirah 
his oars are the small reeds 
When Enki embarks the year will be full of abundance 
The ship departs of its own accord with tow rope held  by itself 
As he leaves the temple of Eridu 
the river gurgles  to its lord 
its sound is a calfs mooing the mooing of a good cow 
Enki had oxen slaughtered and had sheep offered there lavishly 
Where there were no ala drums he installed some in their places 
where there were no bronze ub drums he despatched some to their places 
He directed his steps on his own to Nibru 
and entered the temple terrace the shrine of Nibru 
Enki reached for  the beer he reached for  the liquor 
He had liquor poured into big bronze containers 
and had emmerwheat beer pressed out  
In kukuru containers which make the beer good he mixed beermash 
By adding datesyrup to its taste  he made it strong 
He  its branmash 
In the shrine of Nibru Enki 
provided a meal for Enlil his father 
He seated An at the head of the table 
and seated Enlil next to An 
He seated Nintur in the place of honour 
and seated the Anuna gods at the adjacent places  
All of them were drinking and enjoying beer and liquor 
They filled the bronze aga vessels to the brim 
and started a competition drinking from the bronze vessels of Urasz 
They made the tilimda vessels shine like silver barges 
After beer and liquor had been libated and enjoyed 
and after  from the house 
Enlil was made happy in Nibru 
Enlil addressed the Anuna gods 
Great gods who are standing here 
Anuna who have lined up in the Ubszuunkena 
My son King Enki has built up the temple 
He has made Eridu rise up  from the ground like a mountain 
He has built it in a pleasant place 
in Eridu the pure place where no one is to enter 
a temple built with silver and decorated with lapis lazuli 
a house which tunes the seven tigi drums properly and provides incantations 
where silver songs make all of the house a lovely place 
the shrine of the abzu the good destiny of Enki befitting the elaborate divine powers 
the temple of Eridu built with silver for all this 
Father Enki be praised

When An and Inanna 
had given me the kingship of Uruk 
then with my mighty weapon  
I opened  the canal of Uruk 
I siezed the village of NannaIsa 
I set my foundations at the border   
and  I built the palace of my kingship
At that time during the term of my kingship  
3 gur of barley 2 minas of wool 
1 minas of copper or 3 bn of sesame oil
at the market rate of my land for 1 shekel of silver 
each could be bought

The shepherd stays awake he does not sleep 
When his assistant shepherd returned to work 
He keeps his assistant shepherds awake 
running about he constantly shepherded things day and night 
who walk about shepherding day and night 
After Enki saw this 
Enki upon seeing this 
the clever one was called out and grandly instructed 
called out the knowledgeable one and solemnly instructed 
The nanny in the pen and fold spends the night awake 
The nanny in the pen and fold spends the night awake and keeps me awake 
Go so that she does not bleat before me 
Go so that she does not keep me awake 
Its dung in hand was taken 
Take her dung 
When in its ear he placed 
Upon her ear the left one place and 
and the nanny as if she slept indeed died 
may the nanny as if she sleeps die

The outcry has not been a regular occurrence 
Why the one who is your big brother 
And the one who knows the scribal art better than you 
Why did you speak with empty praise 
You have offended him you have cursed him you have insulted him 
The master did everything

He opened up a hole in the netherworld 
By means of his breeze Utus son a dream god he brought it an aspect of Enkidu out from the netherworld 
He repeatedly hugged him and kissed him 
He was exhausting him with inquiries 
Would that you will speak to me would that you will speak to me

So that imagi and Elam the foreignenemy people dwell in their dwellings 
So that the enemy seizes its shepherd in his very own house 
So that IbbiSn is brought to the land of Elam in a gebur traprestraint 
From the sand dunes of Zabu on the shore of the sea to the border of Anan 
Like a swallow that has flown from its house ie nest he is not to return to his city 
So that malevolent plants grow on both banks of the Tigris and Euphrates 
So that no one sets foot on the road so that no one seeks the path 
In order to break up the founded city and outlying settlements into ruin mounds 
In order to smite the teeming blackheaded people with the ha weapon 
So that the hoe does not penetrate the fertile field so that the seed is not planted 
So that the eellu the song of the going oxen is not sung in the plain 
So that butter and cream are not made in the cattlepen so that  is destroyed 
It was something unseen before and for which there was no word something not to be accepted 
It was something unseen before and for which there was no word something not to be accepted 
The lands were confused all by themselves 
The gods of that city stood outside 
Humanity breathed painfully in their very own homes 
In order to overturn the day in order to destroy the plans 
The storm ravages like a stormwind 
In order to overturn the cosmic powers of Sumer 
In order to confine the good reign in its house 
In order to destroy the city in order to destroy the temple 
In order to destroy the cattlepen in order to flatten the sheepfold 
So that the ox does not does not stand in its cattlepen 
So that the sheep does not expand in number in the sheepfold 
So that the canal irrigates with only brackish water

At harvest time your labor does not match your sustenance 
Your are the one who disappears from work yet you standserve at the market price  
After you are to go to the house of a man giving a drinking party for a god 
After you enter behind the man of the drinking party 
Beer foam is to be spattered upon you 
After you set your neck upon the ground Akk you bow down  
Your own self which is so drunk does not even know how to use a hand is denigrated 
You raise an afflicted hand in order to eat food 
Prowling about in that of the summer for shade 
Prowling about in that of the cooling day for the edge of the sunlight 
Idiot slave lying at the edge of the fire 
When you move your joints your appendages split apart your skinflesh

You stand and you do not do it right you sit and you did not make it good 
You count up the lines to be entered on the tablet and you do it too quickly Akk  makes  get lost you write and you have to erase from it because it was wrong 
You cannot read aloud from that which was written on the tablet ie you cant read your own handwriting 
You incise it too heavily your hand is pierced by the stylus 
For the purposes of counting out the proper number of textual lines it the tablet has not been made suitable in order to be written upon its appropriateness is nonexistent 
And yet you say if the tablet is too small ie short for me I will finish it quickly 
You are one who has forgotten where he stood ie started 
You are one whose place where he sat ie stopped is scattered about 
One who has quit from good sense one who shouts out of frustration because of his predicament 
Who was it that spoke to you 
And what is it that is yours that made you come out for an argument 
Stand idiot in order to have an argument But you should not have an argument again

One who humiliates insulting woman 
Slanderer head striker 
Speaker of hostility conversing in lies 
Continually giving houses but not dwelling in the house of a man 
And you really are among women 
Filling water and roiling waterroiling clear water milling flour 
She leaned she diminished she milled 
She baked there she burned there 
She does not set that which she has created on its way 
You will reply to me 
Witness of idiocy

The one of collegiality the one who breaks words to pieces 
Her case is nonexistent and yet a garment has been worn 
Litigant who has approached the assembly the assembly  
She is confused she is shaking she is seeking aimlessly 
Litigant after you stand in  and  a word 
Pitfall hater you utter words 
They accept the  and chase her away 
And you are really of womanhood

She cannot comb her wool she cannot spin thread with the spindle 
She cannot keep up with work entering and going out from the house are diminished 
When you stand in the street another abuses 
When you attempt to converse with praisequote a proverb it falls at the feet ie fails 
When you  towardson behalf of the assembly they take it seriously 
But after you turn away you are shameless   is laughing 
This is an insult that you make 
In a house where there is beer she is its trough 
In the house where there is soup she is its emerah jug 
In the house where there is food she is the chief cook 
The house whose hand is wet she asks after 
She acts neighborly towards its master 
Entering into that house straightaway 
She sweeps the house she adornssprinkles it 
She is issuing orders and shouting 
Servile laborer of the steward bride the daughter of the house 
She smites their legslap 
She says to them Do not take anything everything that is here is mine 
And you  
Her house is a pigsty her inner room is a kiln 
The door of her house is a reed screen 
A millstone is her husband the pounding stone is her son 
Spouse of a slave consumer of that which is dragged 
One who suckled among female slaves offspring of male slaves 
Your house was built by a female slave and cared for by a male slave 
Lunatic ecstatic conversing in an ecstatic state 
Saying I want to insult the words haven fallen out of the mouth 
I want to talk I want to kill  pig of the marshes dog one who is cut off

At its great gate Enlil stood the door open in the wind 
In Ur no one went towards food no one went towards water 
The people were circling around like water poured into a wellpond 
Its strength was not present in its aura and thus its strength did not dwell there 
Enlil made starvation in the form of an evil person dwell in the city 
He made that which destroys cities that which destroys temples dwell in the city 
He made that which before it a weapon does not stand against dwell in the city 
He made the hungryunsatfisfied and the eyeroller dwell in the city 
In Ur even the feardisdain of head shaking like a single planted reed was not established 
Its people took refuge like a caught fish 
Meager and great alike spread out no one arosewas mustered 
The king was mounted atop the gate tower there was no food there for him 
The king who had ate and drank good things had to now clutch at a mere ration 
The sun was clouded over one was being enviouswatching and knew fasting 
There was no beer in the house of the plain its  was not present 
There was no food for him in his palace it was not good for dwelling 
His supreme storehouse was not filled with grain no one could take refuge there 
The grain goddess was not present in the large and small grain heaps 
The afternoon meal of the gods was not eaten funerary offerings  
In the great banquet the honeyed liquor and  wine ceased 
The giriPAa knife that consumes oxen and sheep  
In the great oven the oxen and sheep were not being prepared ie roasted one could no longer smell it 
The crybreath of the purearmed bursag buildingfunctionary stopped 
The temple that had once belowed like a bull  silently 
 did not execute deliveries properly  
The millstone the mortar and the pestle sat idle no one bends down towards them 
In the lapis harbor of Nanna boats were bound in the water due to silt 
The water of the prow did not scream it did not cast joy 
Sand was piled up in the unuRIbanda buildingshrine of Nanna 
The  rushes grew the  rushes grew the reed of mourning grew 
Boats and barges quit the shining harbor

Among my colleagues comparing with each man I conducted 
And no one who compares with you is present 
This is what I recite to you 
By it deafnessstupidity turns into wisdom 
By it wisdom is made from  inferiority 
It seizes the snake as if using incantationsmurmuring 
I have become weary of always having to beat you and have let that form of punishment go 
Bringing about reconciliation by means of lies I will not consent to you on this 
After I fill my heart and it overflows therefore I scorn you 
On your own behalf you have not ceased your wailing 
But I have set aside your wailing 
Because of the contentintent of what you are to speak 
And the fact that I go forth from according to my word 
In order to go away from according to my words here 
I am going away from here according to my words 
Because you have not observed your humanity reflected upon yourself 
My heart is carried away by an evil wind 
You cannot pay attention to your humanity  
You wailing has finishedkilled me 
You make my heart go in the plain 
Because of what I am I did not send you as one charged with the task to carry reeds from the reed bed 
The  olddead reeds which even the tiny children carry 
Because of what you are you have not carried them 
In no wayat no time have I said Stand at the rear of an ox 
I did not send you as one charged with the task to follow the ox 
I did not send you as one charged with the task to hoe the field 
I did not send you as one charged with the task to sowcultivate the field 
I did not send you as a messenger charged with a task to do a task or to hoe 
Come After you do the work eat food 
Because of who you are I have not spoken to you about this 
Because of who you are you have not done the task but you did eat the food 
When a person like you does a task 
His father and mother will eat food 
If you observe the  of my colleagues 
Like ie each one of them ten gur of barley apiece they fill at the outsetper head 
Even the tiny ones the slave of their fathers 
Ten gur of barley apiece they place at the head ie provide 
They have givenbrought barley oilbutter and sheep wool 
As a man they exceed you 
You are not a man like each one of them 
Exceeding you they do not compare with you in the performance of assigned tasks 
Like them  
It was the frown of Enlil 
After it killed Kish like the bull of heaven 
After it slew the temple of Uruk in the dust like a great bull 
Where at that time to Sargon the king of Agade 
From the lowland to the highland 
After Enlil gave the enship and kingship to him 
At that time the sanctuary Agade holy Inanna

The grain goddess was not present in the large and small grain heaps 
The afternoon meal of the gods was actively diminished there 
In the great banquet the honeyed liquor ceased 
As for the giriPAa knife that consumes oxen and sheep it lay abandoned in the plants 
In the great oven the oxen and sheep were not being prepared ie roasted one could no longer smell it 
The crybreath of the purearmed bursag buildingfunctionary stopped 
The temple that had once belowed like a bull  silently 
The deposit of the properly executed deliveries was a distant memory 
The millstone the mortar and the pestle sat idle no one bends down towards them 
In the lapis harbor of Nanna boats were bound in the water due to silt 
The water of the prow did not scream it did not cast joy 
Sand was piled up in the unuRIbanda buildingshrine of Nanna 
The  rushes grew the  rushes grew the reed of mourning grew 
Boats and barges quit the shining harbor 
In your canal that was made suitable for barges no one was rowing anymore 
The plans of the festival at the place of rites was changed 
The nesag offering ships of his birth father Enlil no longer brought the nesag offering 
 could not bring its nindaba offerings to Nibru for him 
There was emptiness in the rivercanal barges were not traversing it 
No foot was setpresent on its two banks tall plants grew 
The fence of the broad cattle pen of Nanna was torn apart 
The reed fence of the orchard was   established a breach 
The cow was seized along with its calf 
The munzer fed cows took to a strange path in an unknown part of the plain 
Gayau who loves cows dropped his weapon in the beddingdung 
unidug the one who stores butter and cheese did not store butter and cheese 
People who did not know butter were churning its butter 
People who did not know milk were  its milk 
In the cattle pen the churning churn was not bellowing nobly 
The heavy coals that had been lit their smoke ceased 
Suen wept to his father Enlil 
My birth father my city was  for youhim why did you turn away from me 
Enlil my Ur was  for youhim why did you turn away from me 
The nesag offering ships of his birth father no longer brought the nesag offering for him 
 could not bring its nindaba offerings to Enlil at Nibru for him 
The winds carried off the en priestess of the outer city and the en priestess of the inner city 
Ur like a city struck by a hoe has been broken up into ruin heaps 
The Kiur shrine the place of relaxation of Enlil has been made into a windblown shrine 
Enlil  your eye at your city it is an empty wasteland 
The dogs of Ur are not sniffing at the base of the city wall 
The one who burrowsdemarcates wells is not gathering earth at the market price 
My birth father turn around my city back to your arms from its loneliness 
Enlil turn around my Ur back to your arms from its loneliness 
Turn around my Ekinugal temple back to your arms from its loneliness 
So that my Ur is brought out so that the people are broadened 
So that he returns the me of Sumer which were destroyed to their place 
It is the 3rd kirugu 
Alas the true temple the true temple its man its man 
It is the gegigal response 
Enlil was replying to his son Suen

And you fear your overseer 
Your overseer will love you 
If the objective is to be achieved when you speak to your companion 
Do not turn behind for him 
Do not denigrate your colleagues 
If you are going because the day is about to arrive 
How long shall I stay 
I knowuntil my master has left 
Because of what I am I did not send you as one charged with the task to carry reeds from the reed bed 
Because of what I am I did not send you as one charged with the task to carry reeds from the reed bed 
The olddead reeds which even the tiny and little children carry 
Because of what you are you have not carried them 
In no wayat no time have I said Stand at the rear of an ox 
Regarding my ox I did not send you as one charged with the task to follow it 
Regarding my field I did not send you as one charged with the task to hoe it 
Regarding my field I did not send you as one charged with the task to sowcultivate it 
I did not send you as a messenger charged with a task to do a task or to hoe 
Come After you do the work eat food 
Because of who I am I have not spoken to you about this 
Because of who you are you have not done the task but you did eat the food 
When a person like you does a task 
His father and mother will eat food 
If you observe the  of my colleagues 
Like ie each one of them ten gur of barley apiece 
They place at the head ie provide 
Even the tiny ones the slave of their fathers ten gur of barley apiece they place at the head ie provide 
The ones who increase the amount of grain for their fathers 
They have givenbrought barley oilbutter and sheep wool 
As a man I exceed you 
You are not a man like each one of them 
My son their fathers 
Dispatched their childrenjuniors charged with a task 
My inferior like them 
They do not compare with you in the performance of assigned tasks 
Excessive is my exertion for you 
Who is it that has exerted himself for his son more that I 
My words which I recite to you are as follows 
It has not previously been the case Have fear It has not previously been the case Have shame 
Your companion with whom you are standing in the same yoke 
 your comrade your friend you do not observe them 
Why do you not assimilate with them 
It has not previously been the case Now assimilate with your big brothers 
It has not previously been the case Now assimilate with your little brothers 
From the ranks of skilled humanity that resides in the land 
Come Enki himself has discovered that nothing that has a name among them 
Is as painstaking as the assigned task of the place of scribal art 
Nothing that could be named except for the art of the musician 
Like the shores of the sea where one shore is separated far away from the other 
Thus the content of the art of the musician is esoteric 
You can be idle for eternity 
Greatly your that which is released has been enlarged 
Because your  reputation has not been smitten 
Because your reputation has not been beaten into the dust 
Because of what has been destroyed I will recite to you the following for my benefit 
What now to do 
What now to do 
That which I did was not  
Its stolen rushes  carried away the rushes  
Its stolen rushes  carried away the rushes  
Its stolen rushes  carried away the rushes  
Its stolen rushes  carried away the rushes  
 piled up and spread  out  in the manner of sheaves 
 a corpse was in the Euphrates  
 turned away from  and was not saying my spouse 
 turned away from  and was not saying my son 
The one of the true templeproductive estate abandoned his temple and was not saying my temple 
The rich person took a different path away from his possessions 
 the hero  
 the hero  
 took a different path away from his beloved  
The one that is saying  my city 
Kazallu the city that teemed by itself was confused 
Numuda took a different path away from his city his beloved dwelling 
His wife Namrat the beautiful woman was weeping bitterly 
Emptiness was in the river  could not irrigate 
Like a river cursed by Enki its intake was blocked 
 did not have grain in the field the people did not eat 
The watered orchards were baked like an oven the plain was dispersed 
 The city that Enlil did not inquire  after 
The city that An frowned at 
The city that Nudimmud who was angry at 
The city that  fashioned a bitter fate  for 
The city in which the slave raises weapons against 
The city that the enemy did not quit the weapon against 
The city that  will say its young woman does not rejoice 
The city that  will say its young man does not rejoice 
The city whose trees and reeds are sick 
The city that  destroyed in battle 
The city that the slave beat the chest against in battle ie revolted 
The city that the spouse abandoned that the son abandoned 
The city that young woman abandoned the young man abandoned 
The deity of the temple  was not suitable for hisher temple anymore 
Heshe did not retain hisher possessions 
Its  did not wear a garment 
Its  did not eat bread 
Its dogs laid down among the corpses instead of devouring them 
The  birds were eating the corpses 
The men of the front died at the bow 
The men of the rear died at the stern 
In the middle of the city  destroyed the middle of the city 
In the outside of the city  destroyed the outside of the city 
In the harbor of my city  killed  
 bent over ie died 
 bent over ie died 
A  of clay will not be able to cross the river himself 
A  of clay will not be able to cross the river himself 
A  of clay will not be able to cross the river himself

In the  of of the windswept city the reed of mourning grows in lamentation 
In the  the reed of mourning grows in lamentation 
In the  he spends time in lamentation 
My son if you yourself are a native son then it is you who is the one whose tears they are 
Nanna if you yourself are a native son then it is you who is the one whose tears they are 
There is no revocation of a final verdict the word of the assembly 
The uttered word of An and Enlil knows no change 
If Ur was given kingship  did not give an eternal term of office 
From the distant day when the land was founded to the current limit of teeming people 
Who has seen a reign of kingship taking precedence forever 
In order to lengthen the term of kingship in order to take counsel to that effect 
My Nanna do not become exhausted doing this leave your city 
At that time my king the native son quitkilled his liverlungs 
Lord Dilimbabbar fashioned a destroyedevil heart 
Nanna who loved his city left his city 
Ningal in order to go as a stranger of her city to a strange place 
Hurriedly she got dressedbraided a rope for escape and left the city 
The Anuna of Ur stood outside 
In Ur fire that  by itself was extinguished 
In Ur its trees were sick its reeds were sick 
A lament was competing with the wall up to its circuit in terms of completeness 
Daily weapons were smashing heads before it 
In Ur great hazin axes were sharpened before it 
They were setting the spears the arms of battle in order 
Great bows throw sticks and shields were consuming together 
Barbed arrows filled its outside like a rainstorm 
Great stones made a thudding pudpad noise by themselves 
Daily an evil wind returns among the city 
In Ur the noble one divested of his strength stood among the murderers 
The enemy defeated the people those who stood among the weapons 
In the city the ones who did not advance against the weapons dwelledsat in hunger 
Starvation thus filled the city it was not ceasing 
In hunger they were bowing their heads and twisting their muscles 
Its people filled the ponds they were  
Its king breathed painfully in his own house 
Its humanity dropped their hands their weapons touched the ground 
They gatheredclasped their hands to their necks they were weeping 
Together they advised they discussed 
Alas what is it that we will say what is it that we will add 
How long until we are to be finished in the mouth of catastrophe 
The inside of Ur is death the outside is death 
How long until we are to be finished within that of starvation inside the city 
How long until we are to be finished among the weapons of Elam outside the city 
The enemy stands in Ur we must come to an end 
Acting on behalf of their life and their back they spoke together 
They opened the bolt of the gate the storm was making its door stand in the street 
Elam set foot there like a great onrushing flood 
In Ur they were crushing their heads with weapons like a porous pot 
They could not sprint away as fugitives they were seized within the walls limits 
Like fish living in a pond they were seeking refuge 
The enemy dwelled in the Ekinugal temple of Nanna 
They were breaking the holy having heavy possessions bird 
They cut down the statue that occupied the uzga shrine 
Nineigara the supreme steward abandoned the storehouse 
Its throne was covered over from the front she could only sit in the dust instead 
They seized the great cows atby their  horns  cut their horns off 
 smote goring bulls with the weapon like they were grazing sheep 
 was cut down and bound together like a date palm 
The date palm of like strong copper the arm of heroism 
It was torn out like a rush it was cut like a rush it was turned sideways in its roots 
Its top was lodged in the ground a person to raise it was not available 
 trimmed its midribs and set its top on fire 
 its spadix with ripe dates  the well 
The gizi reed that grew in the holy  were actively diminished

You do not pay attention to my pointed remarks 
You do not say I want to pay attention to the pointed remarks of my father

That the assigned task of his father follows the son 
In no wayat no time has the formula lesson been listened to by you 
As one who speaks of the meager things he created 
Saying One should not pain themselves by fixing the eyes ie studying intently 
Saying I sought the place of my father 
Because of you I cannot sleep well either at night or at the midday

Dog with its head pressed to the ground who is sniffing

A soldier who acting like you prowls the streets because of his sustenance 
Possessing a head that is not good for its mouth an evil head 
Dog that licks its penis with its tongue 
Donkey that eats its own bedding 
Wearer of only a loincloth laying down on the oven 
One who drops thingsfalls into a well dropped by the demon lugaluraBlrim ie an attack of epilepsy 
Sheep afflicted with vertigo one who is seized paralyzed 
 ecstatic who eats stinking things

Loose hair that is deposited along with the foundation in the house 
One whose head is half shaved by  
Inappropriate person  denouncerinformer 
Cripple possessing thighs but also blunted hipsbuttocks a blunted nose altogether a physiognomy that is not fitting for a man 
Until one and as whom will you go like this The one who insults you 
May the one who insults you be 36 doubleleagues away from your person 
May your curser be 36 doubleleagues away from your person 
Be pleasing in the eye of your god 
So that your fellow man raises your neck and chest 
And you will be reckoned among the learned people of your city 
And your city the good place invokes your name 
And your god names you with a good name a true word 
Be pleasing in the eye of Nanna your god

For Nanna may the high and low land assemble 
For Suen may he set the roads of the land of land in order 
With a noise like a rainstorm touching the earth may pounding stones be employed for him 
It was the spoken word of An and Enlil and therefore it was being carried out faithfully

Enlil was speaking a true word to his son Suen 
My son a city of abundance was built for you your turn of office sought you out 
The destroyed city the flattening of the parapet of the great wall by the storm this too is a part of the turn of office 
One who  for the dark days of you term of office may open the temple be known 
Previous dweller in your dwelling the Etemenniguru temple which was built faithfully 
May  rebuild it in joy may the people bow down towards it 
May  have bread  at its base may Anan rejoice with him 
May  have joy in its branches may Utu rejoice 
On its table may the abundance of Anan embrace  
May Ur the city decreed by An be returned to its place for you 
May Enlil who is the true speaker raise his neck towards heaven 
For Nanna may the high and low land assemble 
For Suen may he set the roads of the land of land in order 
Touching the ground like a rainstorm  
It was the spoken word of An and Enlil and therefore it was being carried out faithfully 
Nanna stood in his city Ur with head held high 
Suen was able to enter the Ekinugal temple 
Ningal was relaxing in her pure chamber 
The youth Suen was able to enter into his Ekinugal temple 
Bitter storm storm raise you chest depart storm turn backconfine yourself in your house 
Storm destroyer of cities storm raise you chest depart storm turn backconfine yourself in your house 
Storm destroyer of temples storm raise you chest depart storm turn backconfine yourself in your house 
May the storm that once spent time in Sumer spend time in the other lands instead 
May the storm that once spent time in the land spend time in the other lands instead 
May it spend time in the land of Tidnum instead may it spend time in that land 
May it spend time in the land of Gutium instead may it spend time in that land 
May it spend time in the land of Anan instead may it spend time in that land 
So that in Ur the term of office and abundance last long 
So that in Ur the term of office and abundance last long 
So that the people lay down in the meadows and copulate

The princess the one of weeping and lament says

They assign my line assignmentpassage for me 
Come to where I am  
That which my master revealed to me I will reveal for you 
Like you I was a novice one who had a big brother mentorsupervisor 
I jumped about like a dancing reed as he put me to work 
From his instruction only the foolish novice passes by freelyforgetfully 
Fear that is to scare the writing hand wearing it on my figuretrunk and limbs in order to stand before him in the place of prostration 
In order to ameliorate the rage to attend to the anger 
I did the assignment correctly for you 
When I go in the street with neck bowed to the ground 
And my head not to be raised no one scorned me 
Laughing does not  
Humbly  enters the house of my father 
 is before my father mother older brother older sister and female servant 
When I affirmed my intention he instructed in order that  could be seen 
I am the king from the womb I was a hero 
I am Shulgi after I was born I was a mighty male 
I am a pirig creature with a furious face that was given birth to by an uumgal creature 
I am the king of the four quarters 
I am the herder and shepherd of the blackheaded 
I am the authoritative one the god of the lands

Do you know Sumerian 
I can converse by means of Sumerian 
 if you are youngjunior how can you converse intranslate your  
If I hear that of the mouth of my master once or twice 
I can repeat that speech lit answer for you 
But even if your reproduction of that is present what will you write 
If you inquire after that which I write you will find out that 
 my dwelling in the edubaa  could not have been less than three months 
 of Sumer and Akkad from the syllable alphabets aa Syllable Alphabet B and meme Syllable Alphabet A 
To  I counted out the number of lines in a given manuscript and I wrote 
From the various entriesnames of the personal name list Inanna 
Until the animals of the steppe commentary or perhaps the ur5ra list of animals to the end of person  he the lexical list lu2  a I wrote 
I can find their signs 
Thus I explain their writings and solutions 
Follow me lit seize behind me 
I cannot block anything for you 
And the extract of the professions list lu2  u that was assigned to me on my hand tablet 
I can produce a sequence of six hundred entries 
The account of my days residing in the school are established 
My idle days are three days per month 
The various festivals are three days per month 
In the midst of what remains in the month there are 24 days 
My dwelling in the school is not measured with deductible days 
In each single day my master requires that I produce my nigsuru assignment 4 times 
The account having been established my knowledge of the scribal art is not taken away 
Now I can apply myself to the contents of tablets to multiplication tables and calculations 
The scribal art putting entries in their context without nigsuru assignments  
My master speaking pleasantly his prayer on my behalf 
His treating me as a colleague it is something that is to make the heart rejoice 
I know my scribal art

At the agreed point after I reside there 
Regarding the Sumerian language the scribal art its content counting and accounting

My temple which was established by the just man 
My temple which was established by the just man 
Therefore the storm has beaten it at its outside 
In my Ekinugal the temple of kingship 
My true temple that initiates lamentation there along with her ie me 
After being built falsely and destroyed truthfully  must not establish as its allocated share for me 
Therefore like a tent a building torn out at the harvest site like a building torn out at the harvest site it was subjected to wind and rain 
Urim my grain storage filled with food 
Therefore the empty wind howls in the silent city 
Like the sheepfold of the shepherd it was torn out 
The possessions which the city acquired for me are eradicated 
It is the 3rd kirugu refrain 
Urim has initiated lamentation to her detriment 
Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
It is the gegigal response 
At that time this time after the city was flattened 
To the detriment of the lady her city is destroyed 
Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
At that time this time after the city was created 
When they have ordered my city to be destroyed 
When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed 
When they have ordered its people to be killed 
At that time I will not be indifferent to my city 
I will not neglect my land 
For An I shall pour the tears of my eyes 
I shall supplicate myself to Enlil 
I shall say to himthem My city must not be destroyed 
I shall say to himthem Urim must not be destroyed 
I shall say to himthem Its people must not be killed 
Despite this An did not rescind his word 
Despite this the statement It is good so be it of Enlil was not soothing my heart 
Therefore when they have ordered my city to be destroyed 
When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed 
When they have ordered its people to be killed 
For a 2nd time after they convened an assembly a solemn place 
The Anuna rested on the organized ie finalized word 
Therefore I shall extend my limbslap and tie up my hair 
For An I shall pour the tears of my eyes 
I shall supplicate myself to Enlil 
I shall say to himthem My city must not be destroyed 
I shall say to himthem Urim must not be destroyed 
I shall say to himthem Its people must not be killed 
Despite this An did not rescind his word 
Despite this the statement It is good so be it of Enlil was not soothing my heart 
Therefore when they have ordered my city to be destroyed 
When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed 
When they have ordered its people to be killed 
I as one who gave my advice to my detriment 
 therefore shall also bind me with my city 
 therefore shall also bind Urim with me 
An is never to change this word 
That which issues from the mouth of Enlil is not to be changed 
It is the 4th kirugu 
To the detriment of the lady her city is destroyed 
Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
It is the gegigal response 
Enlil spoke to the storm and the people wailed 
He deprived the land of days of abundance and the people wailed 
He deprived Sumer of good days and the people wailed 
He commanded the malevolent storm and the people wailed 
He gave them to the kiggal official of the storm his attendant stormwho stood within the storm 
He spoke to the storm annihilating the land and the people wailed 
He spoke to the great storm the one of An and the people wailed 
Enlil was making Gibil fire into his helper 
He spoke to the great storm of An and the people wailed 
The great storm was shouting from above and the people wailed 
The storm annihilating the land roared upon the earth 
An evil wind overflowing like a great flood which does set down its powerwing 
In the city the weapon was murdering and consuming as if in a pack 
At the base of heaven the storm gnawed and the people wailed 
The storm was burning with fire at its front and the people wailed 
And therefore the raging storm like a fireshade  at its back 
Noon which usually raises the rainy wind fog was burning with fire instead 
Midday which usually brings out bright sunlight brought darkness along with it 
The shining sun did not come out in the land it dissipated like the evening 
The southern wind seized the joyful night which initiates the cooling of water 
Burning sherds combined with the soil and the people wailed 
The storm blew a wind upon the blackheaded people and the people wailed 
Sumer was tripping as if in a gebur snare and the people wailed 
The people were erecting a wall of heads the storm devouring as if in a pack 
The bitter storm for which weeping was not decreed as its fate because of this the people wailed 
The eradicatinggathering storm was sweeping the landmaking the land tremble 
The storm utterly destroyed the city like a flood 
The storm that was finishing the land established silence in the city 
The storm burning like fire was enraged withcorporeally burned the peopleland 
The storm that is to cause everything to be forgotten stood among the malevolent ones 
The hateful storm ordered by Enlil the storm that  the land 
It covered Ur like a garment spread over it like linen 
It is the 5th kirugu 
The storm is a lion thrashing and the people wail 
It is the gegigal response 
At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps 
Father Nanna the city has been placed into ruins and the people wailed 
The storm deprived the land of  and the people wailed 
The land was devastated until there was not even a broken sherd and the people wailed 
The storm made a breach in the wall and the people wailed 
At the great gate where there was a path it was piling up corpses 
In the broad lane prepared as if for a festival heads were placed as seeds 
In the streets where there were paths it was piling up corpses 
In the playground where there was a festival it spread out people as sheaves 
Ditchesburial pits were put down for the blood of land like it would be done for the drainpipe of heaven 
That of the corpses like sheep fat in sunlight dissolved by themselves 
Like a man ended by a hazin axe one was not bothering to clothe his headwear a turban as a bandage 
Like a goat buck caught by a snare one lodged his mouth in the dirt 
And therefore like a man ended by the mitum weapon one did not bother to wear bandages 
As if lying in the birthing place of their mother one laid in his blood 
Those who had not drunk wine nonetheless hung their necks down lit on the shoulder 
Those who served with weaponry were slaughtered by weaponry 
The storm took away fugitive men and gazelles alike and the people wailed 
In Urim the weak and strong alike came to an end out of hunger 
The elder women and men who did not leave the house were set on fire 
Water brought away the tiny ones  from the lap of the mother like fish 
The strong grasp of the wetnurse this grasp was loosened 
Allegiancesense was forgotten and the people wailed 
The treasury of the land was eradicated and the people wailed 
Possessed of everything and anything of the cosmic powers 
Possessed of everything and anything of the cosmic powers

At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps 
At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps 
At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps 
At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps 
At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps 
Father Nanna the city has been placed into ruins and the people wailed 
The storm deprived the land of  and the people wailed 
The land was devastated until there was not even a broken sherd left and the people wailed 
A breach was made in the wall and the people wailed 
At the great gate where there was a path it was piling up corpses 
In the broad lane prepared as if for a festival heads were placed as seeds 
In the streets where there were paths it was piling up corpses 
In the playground where there was a festival it spread out people as sheaves 
Ditchesburial pits were put down for the blood of land like it would be done for the drainpipe of heaven 
That of the corpses like sheep fat in sunlight dissolved by themselves 
Like a man ended by a hazin axe one was not bothering to clothe his headwearing a turban as a bandage 
Like a goat buck caught by a snare one lodged his mouth in the dirt 
And therefore like a man ended by the mitum weapon one did not bother to wear bandages 
As if lying in the birthing place of their mother one laid in his blood 
Those who had not drunk wine nonetheless hung their necks down lit on the shoulder as if drunk 
Those who served with weaponry were slaughtered by weaponry 
The storm took away fugitive men and gazelles alike and the people wailed 
In Urim the weak and strong alike came to an end out of hunger 
The elder women and men who did not leave the house were set on fire 
Water brought away the tiny ones  the lap of the mother like fish 
The strong grasp of the wetnurse this grasp was loosened 
The allegiancesense of the land was forgotten and the people wailed 
The treasury of the land was forgotten and the people wailed 
The mother left her city for to the detriment of her son and the people wailed 
The father turned away from his son and the people wailed 
In the city the spouse was abandoned the child was abandoned possessions were scattered 
The blackheaded people went into s solemn place 
The lady left her city like a frightened bird 
Ningal left her city like a frightened bird 
And therefore the possessions  amassed there were annihilated 
In the treasury which had possessed  plundered itself 
Even in the ponds Gibil the purifier was performing work 
The high mountain range which no hand approaches oh lord of the Ekinugal temple 
The true temple the great hazin axes were consuming as if in a pack 
The troops of imagi and Elam the destructive ones were treating it as if it was worth thirty shekels 
When the pickaxes struck the true temple and city the people wailed 
They were making the city into ruin heaps and the people wailed 
Its lady was crying Alas my city she was crying Alas my temple 
Ningal was crying Alas my city she was crying Alas my temple 
The woman the storm destroyed her city the storm destroyed her temple 
Nanna shrine Urim is destroyed and the people are scattering 
It is the 6th kirugu 
In her cattlepen in her sheepfold the woman shouts bitterly the storm is destoying the city 
It is its gegigal response 
Mother Ningal stands apart from her city like an enemy 
The woman cries bitterly about the fate of her destroyed city 
Ningal cries bitterly about the fate of her destroyed temple 
An must curse my city my city must be destroyed 
Enlil must curse my temple the pickaxe must strike 
He must cast fire upon my  coming from the lowland my city must be destroyed 
Enlil must touch down lightning flame upon his highland 
At the outskirts of the city the outer city must be destroyed and I shall say Alas my city 
In the middle of the city the inner city must be destroyed and I shall say Alas my city 
My temple in the outskirts of the city is being destroyed and I shall say Alas my city 
My temple in the middle of the city is being destroyed and I shall say Alas my city 
Therefore the city is not pastured for me like a fertile ewe its true shepherd is not present 
Therefore Urim is not pastured for me like a fertile shegoat its herder is not present 
My ox does not stand in the cattlepen its herder is not present 
My sheep do not dwell in their sheepfold their herder is not present 
The canal of the city thickens with silt and produces fox dens 
In its course it does not bring flowing water its canal inspector is not present 
In the fields of my city grain is not present its farmer is not present 
In my field like a field that the pickax has struck to destroy it and render it unusable only the star of the field plant grows 
In the irrigated orchards that heap up syrup and wine the thornbush of the mountain grows grows 
In the steppe whose joy was surpassingfilled it it was emitting a baking scent like an oven 
My possessions are taken away flying like a flock of crows taking flight I must cry My possessions 
My possessions coming from the lowland are brought back to the lowland I must cry My possessions 
My possessions coming from the highland are brought back to the highland I must cry My possessions 
The storm scatters me away from my precious metal and lapis I must cry My possessions 
My treasure is annihilated I must cry My possessions 
People who know nothing of precious metal fill the hand with my precious metal and consume it 
People who know nothing of lapis load their necks with my lapis

At that time Enki was speaking to Enlil 
Father Enlil lahar and Ezina  
They have stood  by their strength

In ancient time in the time that good fate was decreed 
An and Enlil established the plans of the universe 
Enki the supreme leader the lord of broad wisdom 
The junior Enlil of the lands he was the 3rd one 
He sought the me of both heaven and earth and founded a dwellingsitting there 
The water that engenders the true seed was bound to his hand 
The Tigris and Euphrates having been excavated on the edge brought water into the lands 
He dredged the small canals the ditches were established there 
 Enki broadened the cattle pen and sheepfold he made them acquire a shepherd and cow herder 
He established cities and outlying settlements on the earth the blackheaded flourished there 
He made the king acquire their shepherdship he raised him to their princeship 
He brought out the king as faithful sunlight in the lands 
Enki knotted the marshes together he made the old reed growth and fresh reed stalks grow 
He made fish and birds live in the great marshes the ponds and the supreme marshes 
In the plain he gave the means of eating and drinking to living creatures 
Enki the lord of abundance the lord of the gods stationed  at its side in charge 
Nudimmud the supreme prince the lord of broad wisdom 
After he created both the fish and the bird 
He filled the marsh and reedbed with them 
He chose their station on behalf of you  
He made their eyes discover their design 
At that time the fish laid eggs in the deep watermarsh 
The bird founded a nest at the intake of the reed bed 
The bird terrified the fish in the deep watermarsh by means of its scream 
The fish stood he was shouting to the bird 
It was boasting by means of a fight he intiated a quarrel 
It arose in the street in the manner of a quarrel it stood there wildly 
At that time the fish was speaking to the bird in the deep watermarsh with an outcry 
Bird releasing ie uninhibited shouting  was not presentplaced 
Croaker of the deep watermarsh screaming releasing and growingboasting the lips perhaps an ideophone 
Spending time eating way too much having horrible diarrhea 
You may be able to croakchew when you stand in the plain but they will chase you away

The young sweeper who is sweeping in the temple is braiding a malevolent rope there for you 
The palace is confused by your scream it is to be abandoned by the agency of your mouth 
They bring one of your kind into the fatteners shed 
They make one of your kind babble like livestock 
They pour cold water into the watering trough for you 
You can then be accepted as a regular offering

Bird leave the marsh remove your scream from above me 
Bring out a pit in the sand dunes thus is what is appropriate for you 
At that time the fish insulted the bird 
Because of its beauty the bird knew about its multicolored back and multicolored face 
Whatever insults fish had assailed it with it did not ponder them 
It was as if a nursemaid was singing a lullaby 
It was not heeding these words laughing malevolently instead 
At that time the bird was replying to the fish 
Thus your heart produces exuberance you have actually humilated yourself 
Your mouth is a hole which  surrounded with teeth you cannot see your back 
Possessor of blunted limbs and blunted appendages turn your neck by means of the fins 
Possessor of a smell that is not good inducing vomiting opening the mouth and wrinkling of the nose

One cannot move in the rivercanal confidently my south wind covers completely 
From before me they are diving into the reedbed and marsh 
From among your little ones you might as well pile up for me as a regular offering for my sustenance  
Your large ones are indeed the solution of the site of a banquet 
I am the beautiful and knowledgable bird 
Beautiful work occurred on behalf of my adornment 
But there is no one who has prepared the working of your pure waxmold 
In the palace of the king I am the ornament of movement 
In the courtyard my noise is a fitting thing one established it as suchset it apart 
My cry is that of a sweet thing 
On the body of Shulgi it is a fitting thing one established it as suchset it apart 
Fruits of the orchard are for my many regular offerings 
babaza porridge malt hulled grain and emmer flour are for my thingsfood that sweetens the mouth 
Thus you do not know my greatness Bow your neck to the ground 
At that time the bird insulted the fish 
The fish possessed of anger trusting in the heroic might of the deep water 
Like a heavy rain cloud it touched the ground it stood in an adamin contest 
Whatever insults the bird had struck it with it did not ponder 
It was able to set its neck on the ground sarcastically it was speaking freelyhumbly 
For the 2nd time the fish replied to the bird 
Bird you do not know my greatness you did not tread behind me you are one who has not inquired after me 
You cannot know either my weakness or my strength you have spoken an inflammatory word 
Possessor of trimmed limbs crippled feet a  mouthbeak and a thinned outflattened tongue 
By means of ignorance you have been able to sneershoutchew but you have not advised yourself 
I the fish am the one who piles up the abundance of the pure shrinesea together 
I am the one who bringsgoesstands among the great nindaba offerings of the Ekur proudly 
Like the grain goddess Ezina I am here for the sustenance of the land I am her helper 
The harvest rejoices with me as if it was a festival my inquirer is there 
Bird what is your great thing that you accomplished I will make you known your over exuberance 
I want to return back into your mind your arrogance and mendacious speech 
At that time the fish was to make plans against the bird 
Silently and deceptively it went on its arms 
When the bird got up from its nest in order to bring back food for its chick 
The fish sought the place silently 
It struck the birds established nest its prepared plants making it a windswept shrine 
It destroyed its built house it tore out its storeroom 
It killed its eggs and its nest with water it covered them in the sea 
For a 2nd time the fish insulted the bird 
At that time the bird with the face of a pirig creature and the claws of a hurin bird 
It was beating its wings towards its nest but its flight path was blocked 
With its mouth it was screaming in the midst of heaven like the nugig midwife of heaven ie Inanna 
At that time the bird which was looking carefully its limbs were spread out 
Like a stormwind that is to shake to the midst of heaven it roamed in heaven 
The bird was searching the fish in the deep water it sought it in the marshes 
The bird saw the fish in the deep water and planned against it 
It seized it it tried to flee in the water but the bird held it with its claws 
It heaped up its little spawn together it heaped them in the manner of sheaves 
The bird took out revenge but its heart was not cooling 
For a 2nd time the bird was replying to the fish 
Clever one inferior one deaf one with muddled plans fish you should not come out 
Roaming the harbor its mouth not eating a storm blowing away fodder 
Pig rogue eating its own excrement  
Guard who dwells in a boundup house slithering by itself 
The fish burned  for me like fire it sought the place silently 
Out of ignorance it got angry it spattered its hands in blood 
In making itself feel wonderful it has destroyed itself 
I am the one who flies in heaven I am the one who goes about on earth 
Wherever I am going whatever is its name I am the happiness that is present on behalf of

It was able to submit furiously it was speaking freelyhumbly 
A 2dind time fish was answering the bird 
Possessor of trimmed limbs crippled feet a  mouthbeak and a thinned outflattened tongue 
By means of ignorance you have been able to sneershoutchew but you yourself have not contemplated 
Eating way too much  filling the courtyard with feces 
The young courtyard sweeper who is sweeping in the temple is braiding a rope for you 
The cook the brewer and the gatekeeper who reside in the temple are distressed with you 
Bird you are one who my greatness does not tread behind you are one who does not inquire after me 
You cannot know either my weakness or my strength you have conversed in an inflammatory manner 
You have not sought the site of my deeds now humble yourself excessively 
Your word has brought release you have not taken counsel with yourself 
I the fish am the one who piles up the abundance of the pure shrinesea together 
At The supreme mound I am the one who bringsgoesstands among the great nindaba offerings of the gods proudly 
Like the grain goddess Anan I am here as the sustenance of the land I am her helper 
The people have listened to me they have looked to me 
The land rejoices with me as if it was a festival my inquirer is there 
Bird what is your great thing that you accomplished I will make you know your over exuberance 
I want to give back into your hand your arrogance and false speech 
At that time the fish was setting plans in place against the bird 
Silently and deceptively it went on its arms 
When the bird got up from its nest in order to bring back food for its chick 
The fish sought the place silently on its arms

The mounds of mine spread out in the plain are a verdant mountain range bearing an aura 
I pile up large and small grain heaps for Enlil 
I heap up wheat emmer and gunida for him 
In the storehouse of humanity I fill up with a mountain 
The orphan widow and the destitute have taken gigur baskets for dragging 
They gather the remnants of my ears 
With my chaff piled up in the field 
I tow along all humanity 
I am able to rear the teeming livestock of Sumuqan 
Hoe one who malevolently burrowed whose blade malevolently tore out 
Hoe one bound to work in clay 
Hoe the one whose head is lodged in the field 
Hoe one who has spent the day in the mold in clay with no one to clean it 
After the water of the river bound the build houses 
After Enlil frowned at the land 
After it came to know the staff of Enlil 
After it was acted upon by the supremacy of Enlil 
Enlil did not abandon the land 
He gave the singlebladed hoe to the arid land 
You bind us in the winter just as the harvest season 
We flee from the place of summer just like that of winter 
The one that binds the arm of the hoe has tied up the sheaves 
The one the binds the arm of the bird snare has tied up the dragged gigur basket 
It has reared the solitary young man and the destitute person 
They gather the remnants of my ears 
The millstone laid down for me the mortar thrashed for me 
It is being smitten by the pestle

The carrying basket my little one is put down with me to workdoes not bend down with you 
When in the marsh an edge is made 
I the hoe serve comprehensively in these situations 
Neither the southern nor the northern wind tear apart my work there 
The fowler gathers eggs 
The fisherman catches fish 
The people have taken the bird hoop traps that have sprung 
Now my abundance sprinkles with its hands in the lands

The field working crew set in the path for you 
Six oxen four men and you are the 11th 
The labor of my preparation as a tool takes away  
When you go out in the field apart from me 
One cannot look favorably upon your furrow which is alone 
When you lodge your head in the ground working 
You are bound to  roots and thorns 
When you break your ploughshare and recreate your ploughshare your ploughshare does not  at your disposal 
Your farmer names you this plow is finished 
Again a carpenter is hired for you a leatherworker is hired for you 
The house of the artisans scurry around  for you 
I the feltworker cut the teasel brush for you 
He brings up a twisting picket for you 
And therefore he is to exhaust the braiding lever for you 
A piece of leather not cut into strips is made to sit towards your head 
Your raisingcarrying is small but your way is supreme 
The day of the new year is ie begins a period of twelve months 
But your service time is four months per year 
Your fugitive ie absentee time is eight months per year 
As many as your served time it is two times you go elsewhere 
On your raftfreight boat you pile up a cabin 
When you set yourself in place there and you removeaccept the beams 
When you remove your facefront from the water like a vessel of wine 
When I prepare a pile lit mountain by means of the beams

Your seed funnel where is it cast

Like a boat that is to transport apples 
Like a boat providing shade to cucumbers 
Like a boat exuding allure at the site of the harvest 
Go proudly back to the brickwork of Kulaba 
Lugalbanda the one who loves the seed 
Was not accepting the suggestion 
Ninurta the son of Enlil 
May he cover the top of your head with the sagu turban the pirig creature of battle

The silver and lapis was something of glowing sunlight

He built the temple in silver he made it colorful with lapis 
He adorned it greatly in gold 
In Eridu he built the temple on the riverbank 
Its brickwork speaks words and gives advice 
Its reed layers within the brick bellowed like a bull 
The temple of Enki is to shout nobly 
The temple brought praise at night for the king while presenting it sweetlybending its knee to him 
For Enki the vizier Isimud was

At that time this is what the woman destroyed because of her genitalsAt that time the woman exclaimed because of her genitals what is this destruction 
This is what holy Inanna did because of her genitals 
She was filling up the wells of the land with blood 
The wells of the orchard produced what was blood 
The servant of a man who went to carry foodperform menial labor was drinking what was blood 
The maidservant of a man who went to fill containers with water was filling them with what was blood 
She took a single  nail

Simurrum  on account of its partnership 
In the corridor of the mountain range of Ebih they advanced towards me in order to clash weapons 
If my king consents

Hero standing on his ribs for battle 
Lord whose powerfulright hand opens on behalf ofis set upon the mitum weapon 
Who gleans the necks of the disobedient like barley 
Ninurta king son whose father rejoices at his might 
Hero covering the mountain like a southern storm 
Ninurta your crownwhose true crown is a rainbow your face thrashing lightning 
 ruler engendered by a shining seed uum serpent that turns upon itself 
Possessing the strengthshoulder of a lion sticking out its tongue in the manner of a snake hissing in the manner of  
Ninurta king who Enlil made superior to himself 
Hero ugal net that overwhelms the enemy 
Ninurta your aura and shade are stretched over the land 
Bringing anger to the rebel land gathering up the assembly 
Ninurta the king the son who profoundly humbles himself to his father 
When he occupied the throne upon the supreme dais when he bore a great aura 
When he initiated a festival when he rejoiced when he sat broadly 
When he was rivaling An and Enlil when he was to be sweetened by liquor 
When Bau was to plead with arazu prayers of the king 
When Ninurta the son of Enlil was to determine fate 
At that time the weapon of the lord looked at the mountain 
arur above on the one hand was speaking to the king 
Lord of heavenly station who occupies the dais in the assemblythrone room 
Ninurta you utterance never wavers your decreed fate is put faithfully in effect 
My king heaven mated with the verdant earth 
Ninurta it gave birth to a warrior that knows no fear the Asag 
One that did not sit as a child with a wetnurse who suckled milk by itselfsuckled fear as milk 
My king one that did not know the rearing of a father the slaughterer of the mountain 
A youth that has left his scentsweat ie has no odor possessor of a face that has no shame 
Ninurta one that lifts itself and rejoices with its form 
My hero who is a bull I shall lean upon 
My king it is one who turns to his city acting as a mother 
It procreated in the mountains it spread out its seed 
Together they shall name it the plants as their king 
In their midst like a great bull it raises its horn 
The uu sagkal diorite usium and kagina stones 
Hero along with alabaster as warriors they plundered the city 
It grew the tooth of the kuu creature in the mountain  were shakingdragging the trees there 
Its power makes the city and its gods bow to the ground 
My king this one has cast down a dais its slacked arm does not relent 
Ninurta lord it has decided its cases just like you 
Against the Asag against its aura who penetrates with their hand 
Who could set out against its great temples 
My lord the mountain has conveyed its nindaba offerings to that place 
Hero it has inquired about you because of your father your lineage 
Son of Enlil lord it has sought after your location because of your supreme power 
My king it has advised you because of your might 
It said Ninurta you shoulder singular warrior never idle 
It has ordered you because ofas  
Hero the intent to carry away your kingship is present in these queries 
Its ablebodied young men were chased away into captivityas corpses by themselves for you 
The city that has not compelled its people to say the landmountain is for you 
Nor has its people said your father  
Despite your holy word being spoken to them may that place back in its tracks 
And the city slip away from its wombmatrix ie be stillborn 
Its woman will not say pleasant things with her husband 
Nor advise him at night 
Nor reveal the purity of her heart 
Aroused wild cow eldest child of Suen 
Lady who is superior to An who has deprived you 
One who validates the cosmic powersrites great queen of queens 
One who emerged from the holy womb superior to her birth mother 
She is the wise discerning queen of the lands 
He has caused my utter destruction in a place of violence 
Dilimbabbar has not undertaken my case 
If he did what is to me If he did not what is it to me 
Victorious he Lugalane drove me out from the temple 
Like a swallow he made me fly away from the window my life was consumed 
He makes me go in the  brambles of the mountain 
He removed the true crown of the en priestess from my head 
Most precious lady loved by An 
Most precious lady loved by An 
May your holy heart which is supreme be restored to its place for me 
Beloved spouse of Amauumgalana Dumuzi 
Who is the great queen of the horizon and zenith ie the whole of heaven 
The Anuna have submitted to you 
Since birth you have been the younger sister of Utu 
And thus you have been superior to the Anuna the great gods 
The Anuna kiss the ground with their lips for you 
My case has not been finalized but the threat of a hostile decision like my case lingers in my face 
The enemy and the evildoer have not escaped its grasp 
In the city that has been endowed with truth 
Which has made righteousness and justice into a treasure 
Where clean clothes are at the quay 
The older brother is to honor the younger brother and behave with humanity 
One is to listen to the word of the father and thus succeeds repays himself 
The son is to humbly revere his mother so that he endures until his old age 
It is at the holy city and settlement of Enlil 
It is at Nibru the beloved shrine of the Great Mountain 
And thus its  of abundance the temple  he raised 
Like a towering mountain range he made it grow in a pure place 
Its ruler the Great Mountain father Enlil 
In the Ekur the supreme shrine he has sat on its dais 
No one can disperse the cosmic powers of that temple 
Its pure place of washing rites like the earth does not cease 
Its cosmic powers are the cosmic powers of the Abzu which no one is to see 
Its inside it a vast sea whose horizon is unknown 
On its platformretaining wall with sparkling standards 
Your Ekur the lapis temple supreme dwelling bearing an aura 
Its aura touches heaven 
And therefore its shade stretches over the lands 
And therefore its sacred space opens up towards the midst of heaven 
The lords and rulers 
Brought the holy nindaba offerings there properly 
And  praysbeseeches him with ud prayers and siskur rites 
Enlil your shepherd that you looked at faithfully 
The one you called to faithfully the one you elevated in the land 
The land to his hand the land to his feet 
You make the most distant place of the lands submit to him 
Accumulated like frost that which is all over the ground 
Its weighty madaria deliveries and tribute 
He brought in regularly into the treasury 
He conveyed nindaba offerings into the supreme courtyard 
He brought them into the Ekur in the manner of heaps 
Enlil true shepherd of that which teems together 
He is the herder and leader of living things 
He made his great rulership manifest 
He made the pure crown and pectoral verdantbeautiful on his body 
In the Tumuhursag temple where he resides on the dais 
He shall lay across heaven like a rainbow 
He went by himself as a floating cloud 
He is the only ruler of heaven he is the uumgal creature of the earth 
He is the supreme god of the Anuna

To advance towards the lowland and inflict defeat against the highland 
To open the house of the emblem

When I make it speak its essence is made known 
I can make it like something at its appropriate time 
Finding the sound by tightening slackening and correcting has not escaped my hand 
I do not play the reed flute like a mere reed pipe of the shepherd 
Intoning a umuna song wailing in lament 
In the heart I have known how to do this like one who does it regularly 
I am one who causes rejoicing I am one who makes things sweet
