I was the grandfather of the holy cedar I was the ancestor of the mesh tree I was the mother and father of the white cedar I was the relative of the hashur cedar At that time there was a princely land among the cities
The ruler of Inab was Tigishemala Now he had a wife whose name was Shagegur Desiredbytheheart and a child who

the ration of a single man was established as single but the ration of Martu though being single was also established as double Martu went home to his own mother
He entered the house before her and spoke to her In my city I am among my friends and they all have already married wives I am there among my mates and they all have already married wives
I am single and I have no children Yet the imposed share exceeds that of my friends over and above that of my mates I received half of theirs
One day as the evening came and they had reached again the place of rations when they had reached it they established the rations before the god 
the ration of a man with a child was established as triple the ration of a single man was established as single but the ration of Martu though he was single was also established as double

to compete with each other in the temple of Inab There were many coming to Inab the city where the festival was taking place to marvel at this There were many coming to Inab the city where the festival was taking place to marvel at this For Numuda because he was holy   
They kept looking for strong fighters for him they kept offering him strong fighters Martu strode around in the great courtyard
He hit them  with a destructive   In the great courtyard in the battle he caused them to be bandaged in the great courtyard of Inab he lifted the bodies of the dead
Numushda rejoicing over Martu offered him silver but he would not accept it He offered jewels but he would not accept them
having done so a third time Martu says Where does your silver lead Where do your jewels lead I Martu would rather marry your daughter
I would rather marry your daughter Adgarkidug Numuda says You  the wife with calves as a marriage gift  Milk cows shall feed the calves
In the byre the breeding bull shall lie down  cows shall live in the  and the calves shall stay at their right side

He approached the earth and the plants do not grow  He approached the ox and its yoke does not open He approached the stall and smashes its cheesepot

He approached the vegetables  lettuce and cress became bad He approached the garden the fruit became bad The eye of the mountain came out from the mountain

He gathered up that which had been destroyed in the mountain and placed it in the Tigris  He irrigated the meadow with the carp flood  Now today that of the horizonentire earth everything 
The kings of the homeland profoundly rejoiced for Ninurta  The field ripened withplaced barley  The harvest of the irrigated orchard yielded fruit 
He heaped up the grain piles  The lord brought up harborstrading colonies from within the land  He made the mood of the gods pleasant 
At that time he also reached a compassionate state for the woman  Ninmah because of the place where  had sex with her was not sleeping  She made her hair cover her back like a heavy ie unshorn ewe 
She was greatly intoning a lament in the mountain that had not been stepped onhad no trails  The mountain does not bear the supreme strength of the lord  The hero who like An in his anger his might no one approaches 
The mountain range shall make the quadrupeds proliferate for you  You a lady with whose cosmic powers no other cosmic powers compare who wears a furiousreddish aura like heaven 
Digirmah who hates excessive speech  The true lady Ninhursag the young woman  Nintur who  when it cools in the evening 
Draw near lady I have given you supreme cosmic powers so that you shall be exaltedshall wield them  True lady her cosmic powers surpass other cosmic powers lady carpenter of the womb  Aruru the elder sister of Enlil stood at his front 
Lord who like his father his utterance cannot be changed you have not yet decreed a fate  The lord was speaking to the emery stone he was wishing forobserving its path  In the homeland the angry lord spoke a word to him 
As one who seized  in order to renderplace my hands   As one who swore to commit my murder  As one who terrified me lord Ninurta in my own supreme dwelling 
Mighty one youth possessed of form your surpassingness and you stature shall be diminished  Leopards that rely on their strength shall tear you up  The powerful one shall accept a test of strength with you 
Young man emery your brothers shall heap you like flour  You young man your shout shall be present and tremble but it shall end  You shall raise a hand violently against your offspring show the teeth against their corpses 
Emery by means of the weapon dog away from battle  like something chased away by the junior shepherd  I am the lord you shall be named according to your having pecked atdemolished carnelian 
Now this is the decreed fate of Ninurta  Today and henceforth when emery touches another stone it will be in order to perforate carnelian thus it is so  The hero was speaking to the uu and gasura stones 
My king attended to the eleli stone  Ninurta the son of Enlil was decreeing its fate  eleli stone possessed of wisdom when the mountain sows discord I shall cast down my aura upon you 
Upon my rebel land whose people confront together you shall invoke my name  You shall not diminish from your healthyintact state  The reduction of your thickness shall be difficult 
My cosmic powers shall regulate your rites  You shall be greatly suited for my smiting weapon which kills the hero  In my supreme courtyard a pedestal shall be set down for you 
May the land admire you sweetly the foreign lands shall raise you  The hero attended to the kagina stone  He spoke to it because of its might 
Ninurta the son of Enlil was decreeing its fate  Reverent youth who sets saturated light to the outside  kagina stone you who put down a shout for me in the rebel land 
My hand did not conquer you as an arrogant one  And therefore I did not bind you together with the hostile ones  The guggazi and marhali stones 
The guggazi and marhali stones  The guggazi and marhali stones  The egizaga girinhiliba anzugulme and nirmuir stones 
The lord   Ninurta the son of Enlil was decreeing its fate  Whatever  you go whether formed as male and female you thus towards my place 
You possessed no sin your hand pushes that which is a wall demonstrating solidarity or inactivity as a conspirator  As a witness you boasted about meyourself  I will rear you inon my lap etc together with an adviser 
Like one who made the claim I am the general in the assembly  nir stone you shall chose among the wine and syrup for me  You pl shall faithfully care for gold which you are inlaid with 
Among the  of the gods  The lands shall touch the nose in submission when you grovel  My king attended to the flint he looked at it angrily 
At that time Erekigal slapped her thigh  At that time Erekigal slapped her thigh  At that time Erekigal slapped her thigh 
She bit her lip and considered the news  She was speaking to Biti her chief gatekeeper  Come Biti my chief gatekeeper 
Pay attention to what I have said to you  She shall drag the bolts of the seven gates of the netherworld from their lock  She shall push the single door of the palace of Ganzer push open 
What is going onis thishe doing  Be satisfied Inanna This is the rite of the netherworld that is being completed 
Inanna This is the procedure of the netherworld you should not speak aloud  When she bent downdied  her  Her sister raised her up from her throne 
She sat down apart from her throne  The seven judges of the Anuna were judging her  Their decision was one of embittered anger 
 struck her and turned her into a smitten piece of meat  The man hung her facefront from a crossbeam  After seven years seven months and seven days elapsed 
Her vizier Ninubur paid attention to the word of her lady  She repeatedly made the lament of ruin heaps for her  She played the em drum of the assemblythrone room for her 
She circled the temples of the gods for her  She scratched her face she scratched her nose  The place unseen when with a man she scratched her inner thigh 
Her fingernails were lodged in her flesh like lubi axesagricultural implements  Her fingernails were lodged in her flesh like lubi axesagricultural implements 
She trimmedthe hair on her head like leeks  When she says alas my heartliver  They said to her you are weary our lady is the reason for your alas my liver 
Who are you  From my heart to your heart from my liver to your liver   If you are a god I shall speak to you 
If you are human I shall decree a fate of death for you  They swore by the life of heaven and earth that they were gods   were to gobring outup 
Water of the river was offered to them but not accepted  Barley of the field was offered to them but not accepted  They were saying to her give us the beaten meat hanging from the beam   the meat that was beaten was that of their lady 
They were saying give it whether it pertains to our king or our lady  Linen does not spread over her holy knees  Linen does not spread over her holy knees 
Her chest does not protrude like a flask  Her fingernails are lodged in her flesh like lubi axes  her hair is plucked like leeks upon her head 
When she cries alas my heart  say you are exhausted our lady from saying alas my heart  When she cries alas my liver 
say you are exhausted from saying alas my liver  She will say Who are you  Speak to my heart my heart to my liver my liver 
If you are gods I will speak a word to you  if you are humans I will determine your fate of death  Invoke the life of heaven and earth in an oath 
The river water will be offered to you but not accepted  The river water will be offered to you but not accepted  the barley of the field will be offered to you but not accepted 
Say Give the beaten meat that hangs from the peg  The beaten meat was their lady  Say that whether it is the king or the queen give it to us 
You will give the beaten meat hanging from the peg  They will have cast upon her it was one with the food of life it was one with the water of life  and Inanna will stand alive again 
Erekigala  the lamentation singer and the kurgara priest  Bring their lady   Inanna brought from the netherworld by the orders of Enki 
When Inanna ascended from the netherworld Anuna seized her  Saying Who is it that ascends from the netherworld who is brought up from the netherworld intact  If Inanna is to be brought up from the netherworld 
she is to give an ablebodied replacement on her own head  The one before her although he was not a vizier held a weapon  The one before her although he was not a vizier held a weapon 
The one behind her although he was not a vizier   The small galla demons as a ukur enclosure the large galla demons as a dubban fence held fast at her side  The small galla demons as a ukur enclosure the large galla demons as a dubban fence held fast at her side 
They came for her  They came for Inanna  They were not consumers of heaped flour they were not drinkers of drawn water 
They lifted the child from the lap of a man they tore away the spouse from the lap of a man  They drove out  from her quarters  They did not crush bitter garlic they were people who did not eat fish they were people who did not eat leeks 
 went towards Inanna  After Inanna came up from the netherworld Ninubur fell at her feet before her at the gate of Ganzer  She sat in the dirt she wore a filthy garment 
The galla demons spoke to holy Inanna Inanna go towards your city we shall take him away as a corpse  Holy Inanna replied to the galla demons My   My flattering vizier my rider of the verified word 
My  the word  When she initiates the lament of the ruin heaps play the em drum of the assemblythrone room  When she circled the temples of the gods she scratched her face for me she scratched her nose for me 
She scratched her ear a visible place for me she scratched a place unseen with a man her inner thigh for me  To the Ekur the temple of Enlil to Urim and the temple of Nanna  To Eridu and the temple of Enki she singularly set out 
She wept before Enki and Enki sustained me  She wept before Enki and Enki sustained me  How could I give her to you

We shall bring him away as a corpse  Holy Inanna replied to the galla demons   He is scratching   my hairdresser 
How could I give him as a corpse to you  We shall go to Badtibira and the Emukalama temple  Lulal fell before her 
Lulal sat in the dirt  Lulal wore a dirty garment  The galla demons were speaking to Inanna Inanna go to your city 
We shall bring him away as a corpse  Holy Inanna replied to the galla demons  Lulal fixed at my right side 
Lulal fixed at my left side  Lulal fixed at my outer pillaras my foremost one   why would I give him to you 
The greatest apple tree in the plain of larsa   Let us go to the great apple tree in the plain of larsa  Dumuzi sat upon the supreme dais 
He sat in splendor in the seat  A prostitute held his thigh tightly   poured out the seven churns 
 shook the head at him  The shepherd was not playing the reed pipe    seizedassailed at his side 
She looked at him it was the look of death  She shook her head at him it was the headshake that accused one of grievous sin  Holy Inanna was replying to the galla demons 
 who is one of the ones who came towards him   you will not release him  They seized  
He was the man among those whom the lady compelled to come towards him  They came towards Dumuzi  Dumuzi wept he was emitting sobs 
Thus the youth What has been done what    the holy  not    who is to die

I am the one who brings butter to the temple of your mother  I am the one who brings cream to the temple of Ningal  I am the one who brings  to  
I am the one who makes the bridal payment on behalf of Unug  I am the one who kisses the holy lips  I am the one who plays among the holy knees of Inanna 
After you prepare my hands as those of a gazellesnake  After you prepare my feet as those of a gazellesnake  I shall escape my galla demon they shall not seize me 
Utu accepted his tears  He prepared his hands as those of a gazellesnake  He prepared his feet as those of a gazellesnake 
I shall escape my galla demon they shall not seize me  Holy Inanna wept bitterly for her spouse 
Holy Inanna wept bitterly for her spouse  Holy Inanna wept bitterly for her spouse 
 Dumuzi   She tore out rushes she cut rushes  She tore out rushes she cut rushes

Sons who lie in your fathers lap where is my precious son   what

The fly  holy Inanna  The fly  holy Inanna 
Young woman Inanna was decreeing a fate for the fly  In the tavern may you pl make the bronze vessel of wine drinking flow over for yourself  As members of the wise men  
Thus was the decreed fate of Inanna   Inanna was weeping  My  arrived and is  to the hand 
 alas   You when the year is half completed your sister when the year is half completed  The days that you desireare requested those days shall be of captivity 
The days that your sister desiresis requested those days shall be longer  Holy Inanna gave Dumuzi the precedent maker as a replacement  Holy Erekigal 
your praise is sweet  Total one hundred seventy three lines  The 3rd in a series of singlecolumn extracts in its entirety text with the incipit from great heaven towards great earth 
The junior galla demon opened his mouth and was speaking to the eldest galla demon  Come let us go to the holy lap of Inanna  The galla demons entered Unug and were seizing Inanna there 
Come Inanna Go  towards your path descend to the netherworld  Go to the place you have plotted against descend to the netherworld  Go to the place of Erekigal descend to the netherworld 
You should not wear the holy ba garment or the pala garment the garments of your queenship go to the netherworld  After you remove the holy crown the ornament of glorification upon your head in order to descend to the netherworld  You should not equipperfect your face with allure 
 you go down  does not   They released holy Inanna they  her  Inanna herself handed over Dumuzi 
As for the youth we will put his feet in the great beam  As for the youth we will cast the esad traprestraint upon him we will place neck in the neckstock  The ubri spear kibir weapon and the great ukur spear were raised before him 
They were sharpening large hazin axes  As for the male they were about to stand they were to sit  We will cast a rope upon his shoulder position the executioner 
They were to cover his own face with his own garment  The youth raised his hands heavenwards for Utu  Utu I am your comrade like you I am a youth 
The one who married your sister  She descends to the netherworld  Because she descends to the netherworld 
I as a substitute am to be given to the netherworld  Utu you are the judge of justice you are never to oppress anyone  After you have altered my hands and changed my form 
As a sagkal snake I shall traverse the meadows and the mountain range  I shall take refuge with my sister Gtinanna  Utu accepted his weeping 
He altered his hands and changed his form  As a sagkal snake he traversed the meadows and the mountain range  Dumuzi like a bird flying from the claws of a falcon guarded for his very life 
She scratched her cheeks she scratched her nose  She unleashed a spearthorn in her side she split apart her garment  She was intoning a lament of anathema for the youth afflicted by anathema 
Alas my brother alas my brother the days of the youth do not   Alas my brother the shepherd Amauumgalana the days of the youth do not   Alas my brother the youth who does not have a spouse who does not have a son 
Alas my brother the youth who does not have a comrade who does not have a friend  Alas my brother the youth whose mother did not release her goodness  The galla demons were seeking out Dumuzi they were roaming around 
They were galla demons without compassion who did not have a father mother spouse brother sister or son   removed from  the one set apart from the universe  You are gala demons those who are to be reglected   
They did not have the power of goodness they did not know good and evil  Who has seen someone with a healthy life without a home and all alone  I will not go to where the friend is I will not go to where the inlaw is 
We shall go for the shepherd where getinanna is  They were the galla demons who were to smite him by hand they were seeking him  The lament was not yet finished in her mouth 
One of them was saying Show where your brother is but she was saying not a word to him  He made her shave her own hair in her crotch but she was not saying a word to him  He made her scratch her face with her own hands but she was not saying a word to him 
He made her own hands shred her garment but she was not saying a word to him  He poured dirtsand in her crotch but she was not saying a word to him  He did not find Dumuzi in the house of Getinanna 
The junior galla demons were speaking to the eldest demons  Come let us go to the pure sheepfold  Dumuzi  the sheepfold  they were castingducking down  
They were searching they were   they were seeking he was seen 
Saying I shall take the ax to the youth like a dilapidated house  They carved him with giriura knife they smote him in a silent place  The sister roamed around in the city like a bird 
Lady who bears an aura amongst the furious me who rides the great me  Inanna equipped with the  aankar weapon cloaking the battlefield with its bloodterror  Who leans the shield upon the ground like one who runs amid the great battles 
Who clutches the storm and the stormwind  For great lady Inanna counsel is dispensed in battle wise one  Destroyer of the mountain she unleashed the arrow towards  by means of her power who smote with the arm in the mountain 
She screamed in the universe like a pirig creature and made the people tremble  Like a great wild bull she stands wildly in the hostile land  Like a furious pirig creature you extinguish  among the mightyclever and those disobedient to you in your bile 
Young woman Inanna as you are supreme like the earth  As you come out like Utu the king as you move widely about  As you move inare suitable for heaven as you bear a furious aura 
As you carry the brilliant sunlight on the earth  One who goes in the mountain range as you bring out a lapis net  As you bathe in the pureflowering mountain 
As you fashion the uba mountain the mountain the pure place  As your wear the udugita mace like the ancestral deities Enar and Enul  As you make heads roll in its battles like you were using a  weapon 
The blackheaded shout this with song  In all the lands the blackheaded sing this ilulama song sweetly  The lady of battle the greateldest child of Suen 
Young woman Inanna I want to praise you  Inanna said I am the lady when I go around heaven when I go around earth  I am Inanna when I go around heaven when I go around earth 
When I go around the earth namely the land of lulubi  When I am to thrash around in the inner mountain  I am the lady I am the one that had approached the mountain it should notindeed it did act fearfully towards me 
I am Inanna I am the one that had approached the mountain it should notindeed it did act fearfully towards me  I am the one that had approached the mountain range with the mountain of Ebih it should notindeed it did act fearfully towards me  Like one who should notindeed did  towards me fromby means of its fear 
Like one who should notindeed did bring its nose near to the ground towards me  Like one who should notindeed did drag its beard in the dust for me  IbniSn was the scribe 
In Ebih the mountain should praise me the mountain should extol me  Inanna the child of Suen 
She was dressed in the pala garment she clad herself in pleasureallurestarsrosettes  She adorned her forehead with a redfurious aura  She arranged the red carnelian beads on her pure throat 
She acted youthfully with the sevenheaded udugita weapon at her right  She set her foot on the staircase of lapis  In the evening  brought out  
She established the nesag offerings for An and established the siskur ritesofferings for him  An was one who rejoiced with Inanna  He accepted the offerings and sat in his place 
Heshe filled the seat of honor of Anheaven  An my father I make a case to you put your ear to my words  An imposed my aurafear of me in the heavens 
It is you who has made my word have no rival in the universe  In the outskirts of heaven there is a silig axe  There is a sign and a mansium royal symbol 
To flatten the platform to make firm the thrones foundation  To set in place the arm of weaponry to bend  like a mubum tree  To yoke a team of six and hold the position 
To yoke a team of four and extend the reins  To smite a caravan to go to the border in an expedition  To appear for the king in the heaped earthsand of heaven like moonlight 
If you inspirelit establish an aura your idiocy  If your dishonesty   You do not approach the house 
You   If your idiocy  you increaseIf my idiocy  is diminished 
One who is experiencing pleasure why am I not your opponent  One f who is peaceful why   It is a fact that you are experiencing pleasure alas it is a fact that you should stand   
Dumuzi They were seeking his head in the plants no one found him  If he dropped his head in the tiny plants then no one can know his place 
Dumuzi They were seeking his head in the tiny plants no one found him  If he dropped his head in the large plants then no one can know his place  Dumuzi They were seeking his head in the large plants no one found him 
If he dropped his head in the dikes of Arali then no one can know his place  Dumuzi They were catching him in the dikes of Arali  Dumuzi wept and made sobbing noises  My sister sustained me in the city my friend killed me in the city 
May my friend station his son in the street and may he not be kissed  They surrounded the man they  the reservoir 
They were braiding a cord for him they were knotting a net for him  They were braiding the zippatum cord for him  They were scratching sticks of manu wood for him 
The man before him was pelting him  The man behind him was pulling him out from his hiding place as if he was merely one cubit tall  His hands were seized in handcuffs 
his arms were bound in manacles  The young man raised his hands heavenward for Utu 
I am the one who kissed the holy lips  I am the one who played on the holy knees the knees of Inanna 
After you have prepared my hands as the hands of a gazelle  After you have prepared my feet as the feet of a gazelle  I want to run for my life towards  
Utu accepted his tears as a kadra gift  Like a compassionate person he  mercy  After he prepared his hands as the hands of a gazelle 
The galla demons were seeking him no one was finding him  Come let us go to  
Dumuzi They seized him at   They encircled the man and  the reservoir  They were braiding a cord for him they were knotting a net for him 
They were braiding the zippatum cord for him  They were scratching sticks of manu wood for him  The man before him was pelting him 
The man behind him was pulling him out from his hiding place as if he was merely one cuibit tall  His hands were seized in handcuffs  his arms were bound in manacles 
The young man raised his hands heavenward for Utu  Utu you are my brother in law I am your inlaw  You are my food carrier to the Eanna temple 
I am the one who made a betrothal gift in Uruk  He slipped away from the demons  It was the house of the old woman Belili that he ran for his life towards 
Old woman I am not a human I am the spouse of a god  After water is poured if only water could be drunk  After flour is poured if only water could be drunk 
After water was poured after flour was poured she sat him down there  The old woman left the house  when the old woman left 
What makes her look around with a frightened gaze  What makes her shout with a frightened voice  Come We will go to the house of old woman Belili

The lord paid attention to the mountain that sustains man  Lord Gilgamesh paid attention to the mountain that sustains man  He was speaking to his servant Enkidu 
Enkidu the shoulder of a young man has not brought out the limitssecrets of living  I want to enter into the mountain I want to establish my name  Where a name can stand be inscribed I want to establish my name 
Where a name cannot stand be inscribed I want to establish the name of the gods  His servant Enkidu was replying  My king if you are to enter the mountain Utu should know of it along with us 
His hand held the pure scepter at his nose  He was calling out to Utu of heaven 
Utu if I am to enter into the mountain will you be my helper  If I am to enter into the mountain of cut juniper will you be my helper  Utu from heaven was replying to him 
You are of yourself a young man a native son what are you to the mountain  Utu I want to speak to you may your ear be oriented towards my words  I shall greet you may my words be listened to 
One has forgotten a man and my heart is pained  On the city wall I stretched out my neck  I saw a corpse floated by the river in the water 
But I should not be done thusly Thus I must be  A tall man has never stretched to heaven  A broad man has never engulfed the land 
I want to enter into the mountain I want to establish my name  The 5th is  a screaming sagkal snake  splitting the mountain range  The 6th is  beating its breast against the mountain like a flood 
The 7th is  flashing like lightning no one will approach its side  The seven heroes the youth Utu gave to Gilgamesh  They will bring the boats for portage to the base of the mountain range 
It was made pleasing there for the one who cuts the juniper  It was made pleasing there for lord Gilgamesh  In his city as a single man he sounded the horn 
As two companions he and Enkidu they shouted together  The one who has a household to his household the one who has lives with a mother to his mother  May single males acting like me act on behalf of my power 
The one who has a household to his household the one who has lives with a mother to his mother  The single males acting like me fifty of them have acted on behalf of my power  He set out to the house of the blacksmith 
He was pouring the metal for the blade of the aagar ax the agasilig axe the arms of heroism  He set out to the grove of deep shade  He was striking down the axe handle of halub wood apple wood and boxwood 
No one can cut a threeply rope  On a wall water does not overwhelm a man 
Fire cannot be extinguished in a house with a reed fence  You help me I shall help you what is it of ours that someone can take away  When it sank when it sank 
When the Magan boat sank  When the barge Magilum sank  A raft a lifeboat seized  
Come let us go and have a look  But if we go  There will be an aura there will be an aura turn back 
There will be cunning there will be cunning turn back  This is your thought but come lets go  After someone has not even approached within 36 ninda 
Huwawa has already seized him in his house of junipercedar  He has looked it is the look of death  He has shaken his head taking an oath its is a head filled with punishment for sin 
You who are a young man to your detriment you will not return to the city of your mother  He imposed his aura into his muscles and his feet  He could not turn his foot ie take a step on the ground 
Huwawa by means of his own strength  he said to him sit  The hero sat down wept and made sobbing noises  Huwawa sat down wept and made sobbing noises 
Huwawa  compassion for Gilgamesh  Gilgamesh release me  So that I may speak a word with Utu 
Utu I do not know the mother that bore me I do not know the father that reared me  I was born in the mountain you reared me  Gilgamesh swore an oath by heaven he swore an oath by earth he swore an oath by the netherworld 
He seized his hand saying you shall not be deprived  At that time Gilgamesh the native had compassion in his heart  Gilgamesh was speaking to Enkidu 
Enkidu may the captured bird go back to its place for me  May the captured youth be returned to the lap of his mother  His servant Enkidu was replying 
The tall if he lacks intellect  The Namtar demonfate will consume him the Namtar demonfate having not been revealed  The caught bird that is to go back to its place 
The caught youth that is to be returned to the lap of its mother  You will not return to the city of your birth mother  Huwawa was speaking to Enkidu 
Huwawa was speaking to Enkidu  Enkidu is defaming me 
He set out to the blacksmith shop  He set out to the blacksmith shop  He was pouring metal into the molds for the aagar and agasilig axes the arms of battle 
He was pouring metal into the molds for the aagar and agasilig axes the arms of battle  He was pouring metal into the molds for the aagar and agasilig axes the arms of battle 
He set out to the deep shaded orchards  He was cutting down halub trees apple trees and boxwood  He was cutting down halub trees apple trees and boxwood 
He was cutting down halub trees apple trees and boxwood  The citizens of his city who came with him  The citizens of his city who came with him

He traversed the 6th mountain range  His mind did not find the juniper tree  His mind did not find the juniper tree 
He traversed the 7th mountain range  His mind did not find the junipercedar tree  His mind did not find the junipercedar tree 
He did not inquire he did not seek anywhere  Gilgamesh struck the juniper tree  Gilgamesh struck the juniper tree 
Gilgamesh struck the juniper tree  Gilgamesh struck the juniper tree 
Gilgamesh struck the juniper tree  Gilgamesh struck the juniper tree  Enkidu cut the woodbranches for him 
The sons of the widows who had come with him  They were putting down piles   Gilgamesh frightened Huwawamade Huwawa shiver in his bedchamber

Those distant days those distant remote days  Those distant nights those distant remote nights  Those distant years those distant remote years 
At that time when a primeval entity was made manifest  At that ancient time when a primeval entity was cared for  When bread was tasted lit covered in the shrines of the land 
When the firebox was prepared in the ovens of the land  When heaven had been separated from earth  When earth had been separated from heaven 
When An had brought away the sky  When Enlil had brought away the earth  When  gifted that of the netherworld on behalf of ErekigalWhen that of the netherworld was gifted on behalf of Erekigal 
When he rode when he rode  When the father rode towards the netherworld  When Enki rode towards the netherworld 
For the king  cast down the small stones  For Enki  cast down the large stones  The little ones were hammerstoneshandsized stones 
It was the keel of the little boat of Enki  The bobbing turtle was overwhelmed  For the king the water of the prow 
Was attacking in a pack like wolves  For Enki the water of the stern  Was slaughtering like a lion 
At that time there was a single tree a halub tree  The one that was planted on the bank of the Euphrates  The one that was to drink water from the Euphrates 
The Euphrates struck it with floodwater  The woman who was fearing the command of An was coming by  Fearing the command of Enlil was coming by  She grasped the tree in her hand and brought it to Uruk 
She was bringing it towards the flowering orchard of Inanna  The woman did not plant the tree as it was in her hand it was by means of her foot that she planted it  The woman did not water the tree as it was in her hand it was by means of her foot that she watered it 
She said When am I to I lie down on its flowering bed  The wood thickened but its bark could not be split  At its base a snake that was immune to incantations made a nest 
In its branches the Anzu bird placed its chick  The demon maiden of the empty wind made a house in its middle  The laughing rejoicing young woman 
Holy Inanna how she was weeping  The day was about to break the horizon was about to light up  The little birds at daybreak were about to shriek 
His sister to the hero Utu  Holy Inanna was speaking  My brother long ago when fate was decreed 
When days of abundance elapsed in the land  When An had brought away the sky  When Enlil had brought away the earth 
When  gifted that of the netherworld on behalf of ErekigalWhen that of the netherworld was gifted on behalf of Erekigal  When he rode when he rode  When the father rode towards the netherworld 
For the lord  cast down the small stones  For Enki  cast down the large stones  The little ones were hammerstoneshandsized stones 
The ibbaru harness there was fifty mina within it  on his hips  He tied on the fifty mina  of his hazin axe the weapon of his campaign 
which weighed 7 talents and 7 mina he took hold  At the base of the halub tree he smote the snake that was immune to incantations  In its branches the Anzu bird took its chick and dragged it away to the mountain range 
The demon maidens of the empty wind who had built a house in its middle fled to the wasteland  He struck the tree at its trunk and cut its branches 
The citizens of his city who had come to him  made it submitgathered the branches  They gave it to his sister holy Inanna as her throne 
He took the branches of the tree for his mallet  The one who always played ball brings out the ball in the smoothed street  The one who always boasted about himself brings out the ball in the smoothed street the young men of his city who always played ball 
Because of him the one by whom the force of widows children was ridden  They lamented with the phrase oh my neck oh my hips  Those who had a mother she was bringing food for her son 
Those who had a sister she was pouring water for her brother  Away fromby means of the accusation of the widows  And the cries to Utu of the young maidens 
He dropped his ball and my mallet into the bottom of the netherworld  He brought his hand up to it and could not touch it  He brought his foot up to it and could not touch it 
Did you see the man who fell from the roof I saw him How is he treated  His bones were not mended  Did you see the man who Ikur trampled with a storm I saw him How is he treated 
He  like an ox eaten by parasites  Did you see the man who fell in battle I saw him How is he treated  His food is set aside his water is set aside eating  food and  water

His smoke has risen into heaven his ghost is not held on the groundin the netherworld  Did you see the man who deceives the god by having sworn an oath  I saw him How is he treated 
At the libation place for the dead at the top of the netherworld  he drinks with perpetual thirstthirst consumes him  Did you see the citizen of girsu the  of his father and mother  I saw him How is he treated 
The citizens of Martu captured me as I was trying to escape before the place of libations for the dead at the topopening of the netherworld  Did you see the citizens of Sumer and Akkad I saw them How are they treated  They are made to drink the water of a place of ambush roiled water 
Did you see the man who fell a the site of battle  His mother does not seize his head there his spouse weeps his ghost has laid down in the plain  Did you see

Envoys of Aga the son of Enmebaragesi  from Kish to Gilgamesh in Uruk came  Gilgamesh before the elders of his city 
presented the issue carefully choosing his words  There are wells to be finished wells of the Land yet to be finished  there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed  To the house of Kish We should not submit Should we not smite it with weapons  In the convened assembly the elders of his city 
There are indeed wells to be finished wells of the Land yet to be finished  there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished  there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed 
So we should submit to the house of Kish We should not smite it with weapons  Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba  in Inanna placing his trust 
the advice of the elders of his city did not take seriously  a second time Gilgamesh before the ablebodied men of his city  presented the issue carefully choosing his words 
there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished  there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed  Never before have you submitted to the house of Kish Should you not smite it with weapons 
In the convened assembly the ablebodied men of his city answer Gilgamesh  Standing on duty and sitting in attendance  the son of the king escorting 
the reins of the donkey always grasping  who has the breath as the saying goes  To the house of Kish you all should not submit With weapons should we not smite it 
and of Eanna the house from heaven lowered down  the great gods created  The great wall the wall which An founded 
the majestic residence which An established  you watch over You are its king and warrior  an exuberant person a prince by An beloved 
When Aga comes what terror he will experience  That army is small at the rear scattered  Its men will be incapable of confronting us 
at the advice of the ablebodied men of his city rejoiced and his spirit brightened  His servant Enkidu he addressed  On this account let the weaponry and arms of battle be made ready 
Let the battle mace to your side return  A great terror and radiance may they create  When he comes my great fearsomeness will overwhelm him 
His reasoning will become confused his judgment disarrayed  Not 5 days not 1 days had passed  when Aga the son of Enmebaragesi to Uruk with his men laid siege  
Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba  to its warriors speaks  My warriors shall have the choice 
Let someone with courage rise up I shall go against Aga  Birurtura his royal guard  in admiration to his king says 
I shall go against Aga  so that his reasoning will become confused his judgment disarrayed  Birurtura through the city gate went out 
at the gate of the city gate they captured him  Birurturas entire length beating  Into the presence of Aga he came 
speaking to Aga  His words were not done a mirrorholder of Uruk on the wall climbing up  out over the wall leaned 
Aga trained his eyes  to Birurtura speaking  Slave is that man your king 
Were that man my king  were that his angry brow  were those his bison eyes 
were that his lapis lazuli beard  were those his elegant fingers  would he not cast down multitudes Would he not raise up multitudes 
Would multitudes not be smeared with dust  Would not all the nations be overwhelmed  Would not the canalmouths of the land be filled with silt 
Would he not take captive Aga the king of Kish in the midst of his army  Hitting him striking him  Birurturas entire length they were beating 
After the mirrorholder of Uruk Gilgamesh climbs up on the wall  the young and old of Kulaba his radiance overwhelms  The ablebodied men of Uruk with battle maces he armed 
on the causeway at the door of the city gate stationed  Enkidu through the city gate alone went out  Gilgamesh out over the wall leaned 
Slave is that man your king  That man is indeed my king  It was just as he had said 
Multitudes fell multitudes rose up  multitudes with dust were smeared  all the nations were overwhelmed 
the canalmouths of the land with silt were filled  the horns of the barges were broken  Aga the king of Kish in the midst of his army he took captive 
to Aga speaks  Aga my foreman Aga my lieutenant  Aga my commander of the troops 
Aga gave me breath Aga gave me life  Aga a fugitive into his embrace took  Aga the fleeing bird with grain provided 
Uruk the handiwork of the gods  the great wall the wall which An founded  the majestic residence which An established 
an exuberant person a prince beloved of An  Before Utu your former kindness is hereby repaid to you  Aga to Kish he set free 
Enlil Gutium the fanged snake of the mountain ranges a people who acted violently against the gods
people who the kingship of Sumer to the mountains took away
who Sumer with wickedness filled who from one with a wife his wife
who from one with a child his child took away from him who wickedness and violence
produced within the country Enlil the king of all the lands to obliterate its name
Utuegal the mighty man the king of Uruk
the king whose utterances cannot be countermanded Enlil the king of all the lands issued to him a command about this
To Inanna his lady he went and prayed to her saying
My lady lioness of battle who the foreign lands batters Enlil the kingship of Sumer
he commanded me May you be my ally An army of many foreigners
bore down upon the land everywhere Tirigan the king of Gutium
opened its canal mouths but no one came out against him Both banks of the Tigris
To the south in Sumer the cultivated land he tied up to the north the roads he tied up
On the highways of the country he made tall grasses grow But the king to whom Enlil
had given power whom Inanna by her own heart had chosen Utuegal the mighty man
In the temple of Ikur he made an offering To the citizens of his city
he was calling out saying Gutium Enlil has given to me
My mistress Inanna is my ally DumuziAmauumgalana
and Gilgame the son of Ninsun as bailiff he has given to me
The citizens of Uruk and the citizens of Kullab he caused to rejoice at this
His city as one man followed after him The military contingents and scouts
After having departed from the temple of Ikur on the 4th day in Nagsu on the Enurigal canal he made an offering
On the 5th day at BaraIlitappe he made an offering UrNinazu
and NabiEnlil generals of Tirigan who to Sumer as envoys
he captured and put fetters on their hands Having departed from BaraIlitappe on the 6th day at Karkar
he made an offering He went in to Ikur and prayed to him
O Ikur Enlil has given me the weapons may you be my ally In the middle of that night he arose
when Utu had risen he went and prayed to him saying
O Utu Gutium Enlil has given to me may you be my ally
At that place just beyond Gutium he laid a trap for him and the troops he drove to him
defeated their generals Whereupon Tirigan king of Gutium
fled all alone from there The place where to save his life he had fled
in Dabrum they at first were good to him But the people of Dabrum Utuegal
he was they had realized Tirigan they did not let go
By the envoys of Utuegal Tirigan and his wife and children
in Dabrum were captured They placed fetters on his hands and put a cloth blindfold over his eyes
made him lie at his Utus feet and on his neck he set his foot Gutium the fanged snake of the mountain ranges
he made drink from the cracks in the earth he made an offering

Inscription on the socle of Sn belonging to a stone statue
Sn beloved of Enlil king whom Enlil
did choose the mighty king king of Ur and
king of the four world quarters for his life he dedicated it to him
Inscription on his right shoulder of a stone statue
from three tablets statues of Sn and two socles belonging to them
For Nanna the lord the great lion of heaven and earth his master
IbbiSn the god of his country the sovereign who how every sort of divine attribute
should be properly performed knows fully the mighty king king of Ur
when in Susa Adama and the land of Awan
he roared like a storm made them submit in a single day and took their lords into captivity
because Nanna had brought them back in his great arm and had taken away their heavy gold and dark silver
the prince with great power clad in fearsomeness with wide intelligence  a golden seventeat jar
whose openings let out honeyed water whose golden drinking reed is a channel running majestically
a thing fit for the firstfruits offerings whose copper sickles are strong multiple reed 
with breasts making things numerous for youthful Suen which are unceasing 
for his life he dedicated it to him A person who the order of an evil thing
shall issue regarding it and from the exalted platform of the divine dining hall and the festival place
shall cause it to be held back may the great gods of heaven and earth curse him
O Enlil with exalted utterances your judgments being high and wide  issuing divine decisions whose word cannot be altered with  planning placed in his hands  ImeDagan the strong young man with the muscles and body of a lion strong youth possessing fearsomeness 
who alone is exalted lord whose called good name is demonstrated in all lands  under his sway he has made the living creatures numerous  and into whose hand were given the Black Headed People in their shelters where the people reside 
They prepared correctly for him the firstfruit offerings of the land  They are not merely left to him in his good palace  At that time ImeDagan the youth the hero of the runners 
the reverent runner who serves night and day without ceasing  who daily brings everything needed made a great resolution  When he rises up it is gigantic a flood bringing a wind in its fury 
With his arms swinging open over and over he flashes across distant miles  like a fierce lion of the steppe going with strength and youthfulness  opening wide his knees on the highway striding towards battle and combat 
like a horse  on the highway with its tail extended  like a buck when racing around inspiring fear   whose his knees when set free are untiring  
and also that which gladdens the heart of Ninlil  the king cares unceasingly for the lapis lazuli shrine  At that time ImeDagan a copper statue which inspires fear as it races against the storm 
in the temple clad in fearsomeness upon his most precious dais  he set it up and colored it brilliantly  The great prince of the whole heaven the lord whose utterance cannot be altered 
his shining brow and raised righteous eyes  may he let be upon him directed towards the faithful shepherd whom he has engendered  But a king who orders a wicked thing 
or because of this curse incites another person to do it  may Enlil my master and Ninli my mistress curse that person  May Enki Ikur Ezinu and akan the lords of abundance 
For Ninlil the exalted queen   most resplendant of of the Anuna gods   in heaven and earth 
like   their daises 
their daises  for kingship  he the one given the crown and scepter
for the great mother of the Anuna gods  the mistress of the Kiur  the exalted shrine Ekurs 
divine attributes to select  the Nippur shrine Durankis  ritual lustrations to cleanse 
to make the divine rites that had fallen away  reappear magnificently and Nippur the bellwether of the nation
to restore to its previous state it was UrNinurta the one serving the Ekur
upon whom Enlil the king of all the lands out over the broad population did lift his eye
and did rightly choose for An Enlil and Ninlil I removed evil
and in the shining Ekur temple in the city   I set them up for them Further copper figures whose bodily features  
were made to resemble me  with an offering kid were made in miniature 
and set up for the delivering of my prayers  as the main courtyard of the Gagiuas   ornament I fashioned for her Ninlil 
and for my life I dedicated them to her A person who an order of wickedness  
shall issue against it and my creation  shall efface
by the exalted command of Enlil  may his revealed name    be revoked from within the Ekur
May Ninurta the mighty warrior of Enlil  be the inseparable bailiff for this for an eternity of days
To Enlil the king of all the lands  his master  Enlilbni
the mighty king king of Isin  and king of Sumer and Akkad  beloved of Enlil 

For Ninlil  queen of the gods  king IddinDagn  
fashioned two big copper statues  but did not bring them to Nippur  From the hands of IddinDagn 
until king Enlilbni  it was 117 years  that they stood in Isin 
desired it and gave command and so   Enlilbni the strong king  king of Isin king of Sumer and Akkad 
beloved of Enlil and Ninlil  those two big copper statues  from within Isin 
to Nippur he had brought  In the great courtyard of the Gageua temple  before Ninlil his mistress he set them up 
the life of Enlilbni  from her place beside Enlil she lengthened its days  A person who shall erase this inscription 
may Enlil my master and Ninlil my mistress  curse him  Maazum

She looked at her it was the look of death  She shook her head   For her Erekigal he turned her Inanna into a smitten piece of meat 
He hung her from a peg  After seven years seven months and seven days elapsed 
She Ninubur scratched her face she scratched her nose  She took a single path to the Ekur the temple of Enlil 
She entered the Ekur the temple of Enlil  She was weeping before Enlil  No one should be allowed to mix your good quality silver with the unrefined ore of the mountain 
She Ninubura set out by a single path to  the temple of Enlil  Father Enlil no one should bend your child over dead in the netherworld  No one should be allowed to mix your good quality silver with the unrefined ore of the mountain

From the great heaven she set her mind on the great below  From the great heaven the goddess set her mind on the great below  From the great heaven Inana set her mind on the great below 
My mistress abandoned heaven abandoned earth and descended to the underworld  Inana abandoned heaven abandoned earth and descended to the underworld  She abandoned the office of en abandoned the office of lagar and descended to the underworld

She abandoned the Nigingarku in uruppak and descended to the underworld  She abandoned the Ecaghula in Kazallu and descended to the underworld  She took the seven divine powers 
She collected the divine powers and grasped them in her hand  With the good divine powers she went on her way  She put a turban headgear for the open country on her head 
She took a wig for her forehead  She hung small lapislazuli beads around her neck  She placed twin eggshaped beads on her breast 
She covered her body with a pala dress the garment of ladyship  She placed mascara Let a man come let him come on her eyes  She pulled the pectoral Come man come over her breast 
She placed a golden ring on her hand  She held the lapislazuli measuring rod and measuring line in her hand  Inanna traveled towards the underworld 
Her minister Ninubur traveled behind her  Holy Inanna says to Ninubur  Come my faithful minister of Eanna 
my escort who speaks trustworthy words  On this day I will descend to the underworld  When I have arrived in the underworld 
make a lament for me on the ruin mounds  Beat the drum for me in the sanctuary  Make the rounds of the houses of the gods for me 
Lacerate your eyes for me lacerate your nose for me  In private lacerate your buttocks for me  Like a pauper clothe yourself in a single garment 
When you have entered the Ekur the house of Enlil  lament before Enlil  Father Enlil dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld  Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone  Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld  If Enlil does not help you in this matter go to Ur  In the Emukura at Ur 
lament before Nanna  Father Nanna dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld  Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone  Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood  Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
And if Nanna does not help you in this matter go to Eridu  In Eridu when you have entered the house of Enki  lament before Enki 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld  Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone  Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld  Father Enki the lord of great wisdom  knows about the lifegiving plant and the lifegiving water 
He is the one who will restore me to life  When Inanna traveled on towards the underworld  her minister Ninubur traveled on behind her 
Go now my Ninubur and pay attention  Dont neglect the instructions I gave you  When Inanna arrived at the palace Ganzer 
she pushed aggressively on the door of the underworld  She shouted aggressively at the gate of the underworld  Open up doorman open up 
Open up Neti open up I am all alone and I want to come in  Neti the chief doorman of the underworld  answers holy Inanna 
I am Inanna going to the east  If you are Inanna going to the east  why have you traveled to the land of no return 
How did you set your heart on the road whose traveller never returns  Holy Inanna answers him  Because lord Gudgalana 
the husband of my elder sister holy Erekigal has died  in order to have his funeral rites observed  she offers generous libations at his wake that is the reason 
answers holy Inanna  Stay here Inanna I will speak to my mistress  I will speak to my mistress Erekigal and tell her what you have said 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld  to his mistress Erekigal  entered the house and said 
My mistress there is a lone girl outside  It is Inanna your sister and she has arrived at the palace Ganzer  She pushed aggressively on the door of the underworld 
She has abandoned Eanna and has descended to the underworld  She has taken the 7 divine powers  She has collected the divine powers and grasped them in her hand 
She has come on her way with all the good divine powers  She has put a turban headgear for the open country on her head  She has taken a wig for her forehead 
She has hung small lapislazuli beads around her neck  She has placed twin eggshaped beads on her breast  She has covered her body with the pala dress of ladyship 
She has pulled the pectoral Come man come over her breast  She has placed a golden ring on her hand  She is holding the lapislazuli reed1ninda measuring rod and measuring line in her hand 
When she heard this Erekigal slapped the side of her thigh  She bit her lip and took the words to heart  She says to Neti her chief doorman 
Come Neti my chief doorman of the underworld  dont neglect the instructions I will give you  Let the seven gates of the underworld be bolted 
As for her after she has entered  and crouched down and had her clothes removed they will be carried away  Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
paid attention to the instructions of his mistress  He bolted the 7 gates of the underworld  Then he opened each of the doors of the palace Ganzer separately 
He says to holy Inanna  Come on Inanna and enter  And when Inanna entered 
What is this  Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled  Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
When she entered the 2nd gate  the small lapislazuli beads were removed from her neck  What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled  Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld  When she entered the 3rd gate 
What is this  Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled  Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
When she entered the 4th gate  the pectoral Come man come was removed from her breast  What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled  Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld  When she entered the 5th gate 
What is this  Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled  Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
When she entered the 6th gate  the lapislazuli measuring rod and measuring line were removed from her hand  What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled  Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld  When she entered the 7th gate 
What is this  Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled  Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
After she had crouched down and had her clothes removed they were carried away  Then she made her sister Erekigal rise from her throne  and instead she sat on her throne 
The Anuna the seven judges rendered their decision against her  They looked at herit was the look of death  They spoke to herit was the speech of anger 
The afflicted woman was turned into a corpse  And the corpse was hung on a hook  After 3 days and 3 nights had passed 
her minister Ninubur  carried out the instructions of her mistress  She made a lament for her in her ruined houses 
She beat the drum for her in the sanctuaries  She made the rounds of the houses of the gods for her  She lacerated her eyes for her she lacerated her nose 
Like a pauper she clothed herself in a single garment  and all alone she set her foot in the Ekur the house of Enlil  When she had entered the Ekur the house of Enlil 
she laments before Enlil  Father Enlil dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld  Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone  Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood  Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
My daughter craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well  Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well  The divine powers of the underworld are divine powers which should not be craved for whoever gets them must remain in the underworld 
Who having got to that place could then expect to come up again  Thus father Enlil did not help in this matter so she went to Ur  In the Emudkura at Ur 
when she had entered the Ekinugal the house of Nanna  she laments before Nanna  Father Nanna dont let your daughter be killed in the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone  Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood  Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
In his rage father Nanna answers Ninubur  My daughter craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well  Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well 
The divine powers of the underworld are divine powers which should not be craved for whoever gets them must remain in the underworld  Who having got to that place could then expect to come up again  Thus father Nanna did not help her in this matter so she went to Eridu 
xshe laments before Enkixx  Father Enki dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld  Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone  Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood  Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
Father Enki answered Ninubur  What has my daughter done She has me worried  What has Inanna done She has me worried 
What has the hierodule of An done She has me worried  He removed some dirt from the tip of his fingernail and created the kurgar  He removed some dirt from the tip of his 2nd fingernail and created the galatur 
To the kurgar he gave the lifegiving plant  To the galatura he gave the lifegiving water  Then father Enki speaks out to the galatura and the kurgar 
Go and direct your steps to the underworld  Flit past the door like flies  Slip through the door pivots like phantoms 
Erekigal is lying there  Her holy shoulders are not covered by a linen cloth  Her breasts are not full like a cagan vessel 
Her nails are like a pickaxe  upon her  The hair on her head is bunched up as if it were leeks  When she says Oh my heart 
you are to say You are troubled our mistress oh your heart  When she says Oh my liver  you are to say You are troubled our mistress oh your liver 
Speaking to you from my heart to your heart from my liver to your liver  if you are gods let me talk with you  if you are mortals may a destiny be decreed for you 
Make her swear this by heaven and earth  Go on out  They will offer you a riverful of waterdont accept it 
They will offer you a field with its graindont accept it  But say to her Give us the corpse hanging on the hook  She will answer That is the corpse of your queen 
She will give you the corpse hanging on the hook  1 of you sprinkle on it the lifegiving plant and 1 the lifegiving water  Thus let Inanna rise up 
The galatura and the kurgar paid attention to the instructions of Enki  They flitted through the door like flies  They slipped through the door pivots like phantoms 
The birthmother because of her children  Erekigal was lying there  Her holy shoulders were not covered by a linen cloth 
Her nails were like a pickaxe  upon her  The hair on her head was bunched up as if it were leeks  When she said Oh my heart 
they said to her You are troubled our mistress oh your heart  When she said Oh my liver  they said to her You are troubled our mistress oh your liver 
Then she asked Who are you  I tell you from my heart to your heart from my liver to your liver  if you are gods I will talk with you 
They made her swear this by heaven and earth  they went on out  they were offered a river with its waterthey did not accept it 
They were offered a field with its grainthey did not accept it  They said to her Give us the corpse hanging on the hook  Holy Erekigal answers the galatura and the kurgar 
The corpse is that of your queen  They said to her Whether it is that of our king or that of our queen give it to us  They were given the corpse hanging on the hook 
And thus Inanna rose up  Erekigal says to the galatura and the kurgar  Bring your queen  your  has been seized 
Inanna because of Enkis instructions was about to ascend from the underworld  But as Inanna was about to ascend from the underworld  the Anuna seized her 
Who has ever ascended from the underworld has ascended unscathed from the underworld  If Inanna is to ascend from the underworld  let her provide a substitute for herself 
the one in front of her though not a minister held a sceptre in his hand  the one behind her though not an escort carried a mace at his hip  while the small demons like a reed enclosure 
and the big demons like the reeds of a fence restrained her on all sides  Those who accompanied her  those who accompanied Inanna 
know no food know no drink  eat no flour offering  and drink no libation 
They take away the child hanging on a wetnurses breasts  They crush no bitter garlic  They eat no fish they eat no leeks 
They it was who accompanied Inanna  After Inanna had ascended from the underworld  Ninubur threw herself at her feet at the door of the Ganzer 
She had sat in the dust and clothed herself in a filthy garment  The demons said to holy Inanna  Inanna proceed to your city we will take her back 
Holy Inanna answers the demons  This is my minister of fair words  my escort of trustworthy words 
She did not forget my instructions  She did not neglect the orders I gave her  She made a lament for me on the ruin mounds 
She beat the drum for me in the sanctuaries  She made the rounds of the gods houses for me  She lacerated her eyes for me lacerated her nose for me 
Like a pauper she clothed herself in a single garment  To the house of Enlil  and to Ur to the house of Nanna 
and to Eridu to the house of Enki  all alone she directed her steps  She brought me back to life 
How could I turn her over to you  Let us go on Let us go on to the egkuraga in Umma  At the egkuraga in Umma 
He had sat in the dust and dressed himself in a filthy garment  The demons say to holy Inanna  Inanna proceed to your city we will take him back 
Holy Inanna answered the demons  ara is my singer  my manicurist and my hairdresser 
How could I turn him over to you  Let us go on Let us go on to the Emukalama in Badtibira  At the Emukalama in Badtibira 
He had sat in the dust and clothed himself in a filthy garment  The demons said to holy Inanna  Inanna proceed to your city we will take him back 
Holy Inanna answers the demons  Outstanding Lulal follows me at my right and my left  How could I turn him over to you 
Let us go on Let us go on to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba  They followed her to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba  There was Dumuzi clothed in a magnificent garment and seated magnificently on a throne 
The 7 of them poured the milk from his churns  The seven of them shook their heads like   They would not let the shepherd play the pipe and flute before her  
She looked at him it was the look of death  She spoke to him  it was the speech of anger  She shouted at him  it was the shout of heavy guilt 
How much longer Take him away  Holy Inanna gave Dumuzi the shepherd into their hands  Those who had accompanied her 
know no food know no drink  eat no flour offering  drink no libation 
They never enjoy the pleasures of the marital embrace  never have any sweet children to kiss  They snatch the son from a mans knee 
They make the bride leave the house of her fatherinlaw  Dumuzi let out a wail and turned very pale  The lad raised his hands to heaven to Utu 
I am your relation by marriage I brought butter oil to your mothers house  I brought cheese to Ningals house  Turn my hands into snakes hands 
and turn my feet into snakes feet  so I can escape my demons let them not keep hold of me  Utu accepted his tears 
Utu turned Dumuzis hands into snakes hands  He turned his feet into snakes feet  Dumuzi escaped his demons 
Holy Inanna  her heart  Holy Inanna  her heart  Holy Inanna  her heart 
Holy Inanna wept bitterly for her husband  Holy Inanna  Dumuzi  her heart    her husband  by force  
 like    like   She tore at her hair like esparto grass she ripped it out like esparto grass 
You children who lie in your mens embrace where is my precious child  Where is my man Where   Where is my man Where  
A fly speaks to holy Inanna  If I show you where your man is what will be my reward  Holy Inanna answers the fly 
If you show me where my man is I will give you this gift  I will cover    The fly helped  holy Inanna 
In the beerhouse and the tavern  may there  for you  You will live  like the sons of the wise  Now Inanna decreed this fate and thus it came to be 
 was weeping  She came up to the sister  and  by the hand  Now alas my  
You for half the year and your sister for half the year  when you are demanded on that day you will stay  when your sister is demanded on that day you will be released

However he did not do any work  He became smaller and smaller   his sheep died  in the sheepfold 
there was famine in irsu  Canals were not dug  the levees and ditches were not cleaned 
The large arable tracts were not   there was no water to irrigate abundantly all the cultivated fields  the people relied on rain 
Anan did not make dappled barley grow  furrows were not yet opened  they bore no yield 
it bore no yield  None of the countries with numerous people for the gods  emmer beer liquor  
sweet liquor or   did they libate  Large fields with the plough 
The river   Its field 
to clean the levees and ditches  to  the large arable tracts  to  all the cultivated fields 
The pickaxe the spade the earth basket and the plough  which mean life for the Land  he established for the people 
Then to making barley sprout  he did turn his attention  He made the people stand before the maiden 
they raised their heads  Before Anan who makes the seeds grow  they prostrated themselves and she made them grow  
Before  Anan who makes the dappled barley grow  they    he raised

Written according to the words of Luinanna the chief leatherworker of Enlil  IbiErra who looks after the Ekur  built the storehouse of Enlil 
to  its great furnaces to see that its canals  waters of joy for eternity
to see that the hoes till the arable tracts and that  the fields to turn the house of Ki which was like a haunted town into a living settlement again its king shepherd UrZababa
rose like Utu over the house of Ki However to alter his term of reigning and to remove the prosperity of the palace An and Enlil authoritatively  decided  by their holy command
Sargon  with happy heart Since he was born 
One day after the evening had arrived and Sargon had brought the regular deliveries to the palace He UrZababa was sleeping and dreaming in the holy bedchamber his holy residence
He realised what the dream was about but did not put into words did not discuss it with anyone After Sargon had received the regular deliveries for the palace UrZababa appointed him cupbearer putting him in charge of the drinks cupboard
Holy inanna did not cease to stand by him After five or 1 days had passed King UrZababa  and became frightened in his residence
He was troubled he was disturbed like a fish living in brackish water It was then that the cupbearer of Ezinas winehouse Sargon lay down not to sleep but lay down to dream
In the dream holy inanna drowned UrZababa in a river of blood The sleeping Sargon groaned and gnawed the ground When King UrZababa heard about this groaning
he was brought into the kings holy presence Sargon was brought into the presence of UrZababa who said Cupbearer was a dream revealed to you in the night
My king this is my dream which I will tell you about There was a young woman who was as high as the heavens and as broad as the earth She was firmly set as the base of a wall
For me she drowned you in a great river a river of blood UrZababa chewed his lips he became seriously afraid He spoke to  his chancellor
My royal sister holy inanna is going to change  my finger into a  of blood she will drown Sargon the cupbearer in the great river
I will give you orders let my orders be carried out Let my advice be followed Now then when the cupbearer has delivered my bronze handmirror  to you
in the Esikil the fated house throw them the mirror and Sargon into the mould like statues Belitikal heeded his kings words and prepared the moulds in the Esikil the fated house
The king spoke to Sargon Go and deliver my bronze handmirror  to the chief smith Sargon left the palace of UrZababa
Holy inanna however did not cease to stand at his right hand side and before he had come within five or 1 ninda of the Esikil the fated house
holy inanna turned around toward him and blocked his way saying The Esikil is a holy house No one polluted with blood should enter it Thus he met the chief smith of the king only at the gate of the fated house
After he delivered the kings bronze handmirror  to the chief smith Belitikal the chief smith  and threw it into the mould like statues After five or 1 days had passed Sargon
came into the presence of UrZababa his king he came into the palace firmly founded like a great mountain King UrZababa  and became frightened in his residence
UrZababa became frightened in the bedchamber his holy residence He realised what was it about but did not put into words did not discuss it with anyone In those days although writing words on tablets existed putting tablets into envelopes did not yet exist
King UrZababa despatched Sargon the creature of the gods with a message written on clay which was about murdering Sargon to Lugalzagesi in Uruk
She gave her feminity as a shelter  Lugalzagesi did not  the envoy
Come He directed his steps to brickbuilt Eana Lugalzagesi did not grasp it he did not talk to the envoy But as soon as he did talk to the envoy 
Alas and sat in the dust Lugalzagesi replied to the envoy Envoy Sargon does not yield
After Enlils frown  had slain Ki as if it were the Bull of Heaven  had slaughtered the house of the land of Uruk in the dust as if it were a mighty bull 
Then to Sargon king of Agade  from the south as far as the highlands did Enlil  give the rulership and kingship 
at that time holy inanna established the sanctuary of Agade  as her celebrated womans domain  she set up her throne in Ulma 
like a girl establishing a womans domain  So that the warehouses would be provisioned  that dwellings would be founded in the city 
that its people would eat splendid food  that its people would drink splendid beverages  that those bathed for holidays would rejoice in the courtyards 
that the people would throng the places of celebration  that acquaintances would dine together  that foreigners would cruise about like unusual birds in the sky 
that monkeys mighty elephants water buffalo exotic animals  would jostle each other in the public squares  as well as thoroughbred dogs lions mountain ibexes and alum sheep with long wool 
holy inanna did not sleep as she ensured all of this  She then filled Agades stores for emmer wheat with gold  she filled its stores for white emmer wheat with silver 
she delivered copper tin and blocks of lapis lazuli to its granaries  and sealed its silos from outside  She endowed its old women with the gift of giving counsel 
She endowed its young women with the gift of entertaining  she endowed its young men with martial might  she endowed its little ones with joy 
The nursemaids who cared for the generals children  played the drumsticks  Inside the city tigi drums sounded outside it flutes and zamzam instruments 
Its harbour where ships moored was full of joy  All foreign lands rested contentedly  and their people experienced happiness 
rose as the daylight on the holy throne of Agade  Its city wall like a mountain reached the heavens  Its citygates were like the Tigris going to the sea 
when Inanna opened its portals  and made Sumer bring its own possessions upstream by boats  The highland Martu people ignorant of agriculture 
brought spirited cattle and kids for her  The Meluans the people of the black land  brought exotic wares up to her 
All the governors the temple administrators  and the accountants of the Guedina  regularly supplied the monthly and New Year offerings 
What a weariness all these caused at Agades city gates  Holy inanna could hardly receive all these offerings  As if she were a citizen there she could not restrain  the desire  to prepare the ground for a temple 
But the statement coming from the Ekur was disquieting  Because of Enlil  all Agade was reduced  to trembling  and terror befell inanna in Ulma 
Like someone abandoning the young women of her womans domain  Holy inanna abandoned the sanctuary of Agade  Like a warrior hurrying to arms 
she removed the gift of battle and fight from the city  and handed them over to the enemy  Not even five or 1 days had passed 
and the jewels of rulership the royal crown  the emblem and the royal throne bestowed on Agade  did Ninurta bring back into his Eumea 
Enki took away its wisdom  Its fearsomeness that reaches heaven  An took up into the midst of heaven 
Its wellanchored holy mooring pole  Enki tore out from the abzu  inanna took away its weapons 
The life of Agades sanctuary was brought to an end as if it had been only the life of a tiny carp in the deep waters  and all the cities were watching it  Like a mighty elephant it bent its neck to the ground 
Like a dying dragon it dragged its head on the earth  and they jointly deprived it of honour as in a battle  Enlil would not let the kingdom of Agade occupy a pleasant lasting residence 
that he would make its future altogether unfavourable  that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures    NaramSuen saw that in a nocturnal vision 
He realised what the dream was about but did not put into words and did not discuss it with anyone   temples shake    perform  extispicy regarding  his temple  
Because of the Ekur he put on mourning clothes  covered his chariot with a reed mat  tore the reed canopy off his ceremonial barge 
and gave away his royal paraphernalia  NaramSuen persisted for seven years  Who has ever seen a king burying his head in his hands for seven years 
He realised what the dream was about but did not put into words and did not discuss it with anyone  Then he went to perform extispicy on a kid regarding the temple  but the omen had nothing to say about the building of the temple 
For a second time he went to perform extispicy on a kid regarding the temple  but the omen again had nothing to say about the building of the temple  In order to change what had been inflicted  upon him 
he tried to to alter Enlils pronouncement  Because his subjects were dispersed 
he now began a mobilization of his troops  Like a wrestler who is about to enter the great courtyard  he  his hands towards  the Ekur 
Like an athlete bent to start a contest  he treated the giguna as if it were worth only thirty shekels  Like a robber plundering the city 
he set tall ladders against the temple  To demolish Ekur as if it were a huge ship  to break up its soil like the soil of mountains where precious metals are mined 
to prostrate it like a city inundated by Ikur  alhough the temple was not the Mountains of Cedarfelling  he had large axes cast 
he had doubleedged agasilig axes sharpened to be used against it  He set spades against its roots  and it sank as low as the foundation of the Land 
He put axes against its top  and the temple like a dead soldier bowed its neck before him  and all the foreign lands bowed their necks before him 
and all the rain went back to the heavens  He tore off its upper lintel and the Land was deprived of its ornament  From its Gate from which Grain is never Diverted he diverted grain 
and the Land was deprived of grain  He struck the Gate of WellBeing with the pickaxe  and wellbeing was subverted in all the foreign lands 
As if they were for great tracts of land with wide carpfilled waters  he cast large spades to be used against the Ekur  The people could see the bedchamber its room which knows no daylight 
its laama deities of the great pilasters standing at the temple  though they had committed no sacrilege  were thrown into the fire by NaramSuen 
The cedar cypress juniper and boxwood  the woods of its giguna were  by him  He put its gold in containers 
and put its silver in leather bags  He filled the docks with its copper as if it were a huge transport of grain  The silversmiths were reshaping its silver 
smiths were beating its copper  Though they were not the goods of a plundered city  large ships were moored at the temple 
large ships were moored at Enlils temple  and its possessions were taken away from the city  With the possessions being taken away from the city 
good sense left Agade  As the ships moved away from the docks Agades intelligence was removed  The roaring storm that subjugates the entire land 
Enlil was considering what should be destroyed in return for the wrecking of his beloved Ekur  He lifted his gaze towards the Gubin mountains  and made all the inhabitants of the broad mountain ranges descend  
Those who do not resemble other people who are not reckoned as part of the Land  the Gutians an unbridled people  with human intelligence but canine instincts and monkeys features  
Enlil brought them out of the mountains  Like small birds they swooped on the ground in great flocks  Because of Enlil they stretched their arms out across the plain like a net for animals 
no one left their grasp  Messengers no longer travelled the highways  the couriers boat no longer passed along the rivers 
The Gutians drove the trusty  goats of Enlil out of their folds and compelled their herdsmen to follow them they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them  they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them  Prisoners manned the watch 
Brigands occupied the highways  The doors of the city gates of the Land lay dislodged in mud  and all the foreign lands uttered bitter cries from the walls of their cities 
As if it had been before the time when cities were built and founded  the large arable tracts yielded no grain  the inundated tracts yielded no fish 
the irrigated orchards yielded no syrup or wine  the thick clouds  did not rain the magurum plant did not grow  In those days oil for one shekel was only half a litre 
grain for one shekel was only half a litre  wool for one shekel was only one mina  fish for one shekel filled only one ban measure 
Those who lay down on the roof died on the roof  those who lay down in the house were not buried  People were flailing at themselves from hunger 
By the Kiur Enlils great place  dogs were packed together in the silent streets  if two men walked there they would be devoured by them 
and if three men walked there they would be devoured by them  Noses were punched  heads were smashed   noses  were piled up heads were sown like seeds 
heroes lay dead on top of heroes  the blood of traitors ran upon the blood of honest men  At that time Enlil rebuilt his great sanctuaries 
into small reed  sanctuaries  and from east to west he reduced their storehouses  The old women who survived those days 
the old men who survived those days  and the chief lamentation singer who survived those years  for seven days and seven nights 
ub meze and lilis drums made them resound to Enlil like Ikur  The old women did not restrain the cry Alas for my city  The old men did not restrain the cry Alas for its people 
The lamentation singer did not restrain the cry Alas for the Ekur  Its young women did not restrain from tearing their hair  Its young men did not restrain from sharpening their knives 
Their laments were as if Enlils ancestors  were performing a lament in the aweinspiring Holy Mound by the holy knees of Enlil  Because of this Enlil entered his holy bedchamber and lay down fasting 
cooled Enlils heart with cool water and prayed to him  Enlil may the city that destroyed your city be treated as your city has been treated  May the one that defiled your giguna be treated as Nibru 
In this city may heads fill the wells  May no one find his acquaintances there  may brother not recognise brother 
May its young woman be cruelly killed in her womans domain  may its old man cry in distress for his slain wife  May its pigeons moan on their window ledges 
may it live in constant anxiety like a timid pigeon  Again Suen Enki inanna Ninurta Ikur Utu Nuska and Nisaba all the gods whosoever  turned their attention to the city 
and cursed Agade severely  City you pounced on Ekur it is as if you had pounced on Enlil  Agade you pounced on Ekur it is as if you had pounced on Enlil 
May your holy walls to their highest point resound with mourning  May your giguna be reduced to a pile of dust  May your pilasters with the standing lahama deities 
May your clay be returned to its abzu  may it be clay cursed by Enki  May your grain be returned to its furrow 
may it be grain cursed by Ezina  May your timber be returned to its forest  may it be timber cursed by Ninilduma 
May the cattle slaughterer slaughter his wife  may your sheep butcher butcher his child  May water wash away your pauper as he is looking for  
May your pregnant  priestesses and cult prostitutes abort  their children  May your gold be bought for the price of silver  may your silver be bought for the price of pyrite  
and may your copper be bought for the price of lead  Agade may your strong man be deprived of his strength  so that he will be unable to lift his sack of provisions and  
and will not have the joy of controlling your superior asses may he lie idle all day  May this make the city die of hunger  May your citizens who used to eat fine food lie hungry 
eat the coating on his roof  The leather hinges on the main door of his fathers house  may he chew their leather hinges 
May depression descend upon your palace built for joy  May the evils of the desert the silent place howl continuously  Your uzga precinct established for purification ceremonies 
may foxes that frequent its ruin mounds and brush it with their tails  Your gateways established for the Land  May the ukuku the bird of depression make its nest in them 
that could not rest from its joy  may the bulls of Nanna that fill the pens  bellow like those who wander in the desert the silent place 
May the grass grow long on your canalbank towpaths  may the grass of mourning grow on your highways laid for waggons  Moreover on your towpaths built up with canal sediment 
may  wild rams  and alert snakes of the mountains allow no one to pass  In your plains where fine grass grows may the reed of lamentation grow  Agade may brackish water flow where fresh water flowed for you 
If someone decides I will rest in Agade may he not enjoy the pleasures of a resting place  And before Utu on that very day so it was  On its canal bank towpaths the grass grew long 
On its highways laid for waggons the grass of mourning grew  Moreover on its towpaths built up with canal sediment  wild rams  and alert snakes of the mountains allowed no one to pass 
On its plains where fine grass grew now the reeds of lamentation grew  Agades flowing fresh water flowed as brackish water  When someone decided I will dwell in that city he could not enjoy the pleasures of a dwelling place 
For the destruction of Agade Inanna be praised  Enki took away its wisdom  Its fearsomeness that reaches heaven 
An took it up into the midst of heaven  Its wellanchored holy mooring pole  Enki tore it out from the abzu 
That he would make its future altogether unfavourable  that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures    NaramSuen saw that in a nocturnal vision 
as if he were to change what had been inflicted  upon him  His subjects were dispersed  so he began a mobilization of his troops 
Like a wrestler who is about to enter the great courtyard  he  his hands towards  the Ekur  Like an athlete bent to start a contest 
he treated the giguna as if it were worth only thirty shekels  Like a robber plundering the city  he set tall ladders against the temple 
he had large axes cast to be used against it  He had doubleedged agasilig axes sharpened to be used against it  As if they were for great tracts of land with huge carpfilled waters 
and the Land was deprived of grain  He struck the Gate of WellBeing with the pickaxe  and wellbeing was destroyed in all the foreign lands 

Noses were punched heads were smashed   noses  were piled up heads were sown like seeds  Heroes lay  dead on top of heroes 
the blood of traitors ran  upon honest men  Enlil rebuilt his great sanctuaries  into small reed  sanctuaries

The storm that came to be  its lamentation hangs heavy on me  Raging about because of the storm  I am the woman for whom the storm came to be 
 its lamentation hangs heavy on me  I trembled on account of that day  but I did not flee before the days violence 
Because of this debilitating storm I could not see a good day for my rule not one good day for my rule  The bitter lament having come to be for me during the night  trembled on account of that night 
but I did not flee before the nights violence  The awesomeness of this storm destructive as the flood truly hangs heavy on me  Because of its existence in my nightly sleeping place even in my nightly sleeping place truly there was no peace for me 
Nor because of this debilitating storm was the quiet of my sleeping place not even the quiet of my sleeping place allowed to me  2 mss add 1 line Truly I did not forsake my Land 
Because there was bitterness in my Land  I trudged the earth like a cow for its calf  My Land was not granted success 
Because there was bitter distress in my city  I beat my wings like a bird of heaven  and flew to my city 
and my city was destroyed in its foundations  and Ur perished where it lay  Because the hand of the storm appeared above 
The storms breast did not rise  To me the woman in the Agrunkug my house of queenship  they did not grant a reign of distant days 
Indeed they established weeping and lamentation for me  As for the house which used to be where the spirit of the blackheaded people was soothed  instead of its festivals wrath and terror indeed multiply 
Because of this debilitating storm into my house the favourable place  my devastated righteous house upon which no eye had been cast  depression and lament and bitterness 
My house founded by the righteous  was pushed over on its side like a garden fence  For Ekinugal my house of royalty 
the good house my house which has been given over to tears  its building falsely and its perishing truly   they granted this to me as its lot and share 
As onto a tent a shelter on the denuded harvest ground  as onto a shelter on the denuded harvest ground wind and rain have been made to fall on it  Ur my allsurpassing chamber

when they had directed that its people be killed  on that day I did not abandon my city  I did not forsake my land 
Truly I shed my tears before An  Truly I myself made supplication to Enlil  Let not my city be destroyed I implored them 
Let not Ur be destroyed I implored them  Let not its people perish I implored them  But An did not change that word 
A second time when the council had settled itself in the preeminent place  and the Anuna had seated themselves to ratify decisions  I prostrated  myself and stretched out my arms 
Truly I shed my tears before An  Truly I myself made supplication to Enlil  Let not my city be destroyed I implored them 
Let not Ur be destroyed I implored them  Let not its people perish I implored them  But An did not change that word 
They gave instructions that my city should be utterly destroyed  They gave instructions that Ur should be utterly destroyed  They decreed its destiny that its people should be killed 
In return for the speech  which I had given them  they both bound me together with my city  and also bound my Ur together with me

He called upon the storm that annihilates the Land  the people groan  He called upon the evil gales  the people groan  Enlil brought Gibil as his aid 
The great storm howls above  the people groan  The storm that annihilates the Land roars below  the people groan  The evil wind like a rushing torrent cannot be restrained 
The weapons in the city smash heads and consume indiscriminately  The storm whirled gloom around the base of the horizon  the people groan  In front of the storm heat blazes  the people groan 
A fiery glow burns with the raging storm  After the haze had lifted at noon he made fires blaze  He locked up the day and the rising of the bright sun together with the good storm 
n the delightful night the time when coolness sets in he redoubled the south wind  The scorching potsherds made the dust glow   the people groan  He swept the winds over the blackheaded people  the people groan 
Sumer was overturned by a snare  the people groan  It attacked  the Land and devoured it completely  Tears cannot influence the bitter storm  the people groan 
The reaping storm dragged across the Land  Like a flood storm it completely destroyed the city  The storm that annihilates the Land silenced the city 
The storm blazing like fire performed its task upon the people  The storm ordered by Enlil in hate the storm which wears away the Land  covered Ur like a garment was spread out over it like linen

2 mss add 1 line The good storm was taken from Sumer  the people groan  Its people littered its outskirts just as if they might have been broken potsherds 
Breaches had been made in its walls  the people groan  On its lofty citygates where walks had been taken corpses were piled  On its boulevards where festivals had been held heads lay scattered  
In all its streets where walks had been taken corpses were piled  In its places where the dances of the Land had taken place people were stacked in heaps  They made the blood of the Land flow down the wadis like copper or tin 
Its corpses like fat left in the sun melted away of themselves  The heads of its men slain by the axe were not covered with a cloth  Like a gazelle caught in a trap their mouths bit the dust 
As if in the place where their mothers had laboured they lay in their own blood  Its men who were finished off by the battlemace were not bandaged with new  cloth  Although they were not drunk with strong drink their necks drooped on their shoulders 
He who stood up to the weapon was crushed by the weapon  the people groan  He who ran away from it was overwhelmed  by the storm  the people groan  The weak and the strong of Ur perished from hunger 
Mothers and fathers who did not leave their houses were consumed by fire  The little ones lying in their mothers arms were carried off like fish by the waters  Among the nursemaids with their strong embrace the embrace was pried open 
The Lands counsel was swallowed by a swamp  the people groan  The mother absconded before her childs eyes  the people groan  The father turned away from his child  the people groan 
In the city the wife was abandoned the child was abandoned possessions were scattered about  The blackheaded people were carried off from their strongholds  Its queen like a bird in fright departed from her city 
Ningal like a bird in fright departed from her city  All the treasures accumulated in the Land were defiled  In all the storehouses abounding in the Land fires were kindled 
The good house of the lofty untouchable mountain Ekinugal  was entirely devoured by large axes  The people of imaki and Elam the destroyers counted its worth as only thirty shekels

Outside the city the outer city was destroyed before me  I shall cry Alas my city  Inside the city the inner city was destroyed before me  I shall cry Alas my city  My houses of the outer city were destroyed  I shall cry Alas my houses 
My houses of the inner city were destroyed  I shall cry Alas my houses  My city no longer multiplies for me like good ewes its good shepherd is gone  Ur no longer multiplies for me like good ewes its shepherd boy is gone 
My bull no longer crouches in its cowpen its herdsman is gone  My sheep no longer crouch in their fold their herdsman is gone  In the river of my city dust has gathered and the holes of foxes have been dug there 
In the fields of my city there is no grain their farmer is gone  My fields like fields from which the hoe has been kept away  have grown tangled  weeds  My orchards and gardens that produced abundant syrup and wine have grown mountain thornbushes 
My plain that used to be covered in its luxurious verdure has become cracked  like a kiln  My possessions like a flock of rooks rising up have risen in flight  I shall cry O my possessions  He who came from the south has carried my possessions off to the south  I shall cry O my possessions 
He who came from the highlands has carried my possessions off to the highlands  I shall cry O my possessions  My silver gems and lapis lazuli have been scattered about  I shall cry O my possessions  The swamp has swallowed my treasures  I shall cry O my possessions 
Men ignorant of gems have fastened my gems around their necks  My small birds and fowl have flown away  I shall say Alas my city  My slavegirls and children have been carried off by boat  I shall say Alas my city 
Woe is me my slavegirls bear strange emblems in a strange city  My young men mourn in a desert they do not know  Woe is me my city which no longer exists  I am not its queen

Your house like a man who has lost everything stretches out  its hands to you  Your brickbuilt righteous house like a human being cries Where are you  My queen you have indeed left the house you have left the city 
How long will you stand aside from your city like an enemy  Mother Ningal you confronted your city like an enemy  Although you are a queen who loves her city you abandoned your sheepfold 
Although you are one who cares for her Land you set it on fire  Mother Ningal return like a bull to your cattlepen like a sheep to your fold  like a bull to your cattlepen of former days like a sheep to your fold

that its numerous blackheaded people should be slaughtered  that the hoe should not attack the fertile fields that seed should not be planted in the ground  that the melody of the cowherds songs should not resound in the open country 
that butter and cheese should not be made in the cattlepen that dung should not be stacked on the ground  that the shepherd should not enclose the sacred sheepfold with a fence  that the song of the churning should not resound in the sheepfold 
to decimate the animals of the open country to finish off all living things  that the fourlegged creatures of akkan should lay no more dung on the ground  that the marshes should be so dry as to be full of cracks and have no new seed 
that there should be no new growth in the orchards that it should all collapse by itself  Ur the great charging wild bull confident in its own strength  the primeval city of lordship and kingship built on sacred ground  
 so as quickly to subdue it like a roped ox to bow its neck to the ground  An Enlil Enki and Ninursaga have decided this as its fate  Its fate cannot be changed Who can overturn it 
It is the command of An and Enlil Who can oppose it  An frightened the very dwellings of Sumer the people were afraid  Enlil blew an evil storm silence lay upon the city 
Enki blocked the water in the Tigris and the Euphrates  Utu took away the pronouncement of equity and justice  inanna handed over victory in strife and battle to a rebellious land 
Ningirsu poured Sumer away like milk to the dogs  Turmoil descended upon the Land something that no one had ever known  something unseen which had no name something that could not be fathomed 
The lands were confused in their fear  The god of the city turned away its shepherd vanished  The people in their fear breathed only with difficulty 
There was no return for them the storm did not retreat  This is what Enlil the shepherd of the blackheaded people did  Enlil to destroy the loyal households to decimate the loyal men 
to put the evil eye on the sons of the loyal men on the firstborn  Enlil then sent down Gutium from the mountains  Their advance was as the flood of Enlil that cannot be withstood 
The great wind of the countryside filled the countryside it advanced before them  The extensive countryside was destroyed no one moved about there  The dark time was roasted by hailstones and flames 
The bright time was wiped out by a shadow  2 mss add 2 lines In the darkness noses were heaped up heads were smashed  The storm was a harrow coming from above the city was struck by a hoe 
On that day heaven rumbled the earth trembled the storm worked without respite  Heaven was darkened it was covered by a shadow the mountains roared  Utu lay down at the horizon dust passed over the mountains 
Nanna lay at the zenith the people were afraid  The citys god left his dwelling and stood aside  The foreigners in the city even chased away its dead 
Large trees were uprooted the forest growth was ripped out  The orchards were stripped of their fruit they were cleaned of their offshoots  The crop drowned while it was still on the stalk 
They piled  up in heaps they spread  out like sheaves  They piled  up in heaps they spread  out like sheaves  They piled  up in heaps they spread  out like sheaves 
There were corpses floating in the Euphrates weapons smashed heads  The father turned away from his wife saying This is not my wife  The mother turned away from her child saying This is not my child 
He who had a productive estate neglected his estate saying This is not my estate  The rich man took an unfamiliar path away from his possessions  In those days the kingship of the Land was defiled 
The lands that had followed the same path were split into disunity  The food offerings of Ur the shrine of magnificent food offerings were changed for the worse  Nanna traded away his people numerous as ewes 
Its king sat immobilised in his own palace  IbbiSuen was sitting in anguish in his own palace  In Enamtila his place of delight he wept bitterly 
The flood dashing a hoe on the ground was levelling everything  Like a great storm it roared over the earth  who could escape it  To destroy the city to destroy the house 
and the blood of traitors flow upon loyal men  1st kirugu  The storms gather to strike like a flood

Nane the noble daughter was settled outside the city  Fire approached Ninmarki in the shrine Guaba  Large boats were carrying off its silver and lapis lazuli 
On that day he decreed a storm blazing like the mouth of a fire  The province of Laga was handed over to Elam  And then the queen also reached the end of her time

Its sacred ipar of en priesthood was defiled  Its en priestess was snatched from the ipar and carried off to enemy territory  A lament was raised at the dais that stretches out toward heaven

Eridug floating on great waters was deprived  of drinking water  In its outer environs which had turned into haunted plains   The loyal man in a place of treachery  
Kaegala and Igiegala   I a young man whom the storm has not destroyed   I not destroyed by the storm my attractiveness not brought to an end  
We have been struck down like beautiful boxwood trees  We have been struck down like  with coloured eyes  We have been struck down like statues being cast in moulds 
We turned to Father Enki in the abzu of Eridug   whatever we shall say whatever we shall add   whatever we shall say whatever we shall add 
we came out from the  of Eridug  While were in charge of  during the day the shadows   While we were in charge of  during the night the storm  
What do we receive trembling on duty during the day  What do we lose not sleeping on duty during the night  Enki your city has been cursed it has been given to an enemy land 
Why do they destroy us like palm trees which we have not tended  Why do they break us up like new boats we have not caulked  After Enki had cast his eyes on a foreign land

Damgalnuna the mother of the Ema wept bitter tears  Alas the destroyed city my destroyed house  Its sacred ipar of en priesthood was defiled 
In Ur no one went to fetch food no one went to fetch water  Those who went to fetch food went away from the food and will not return  Those who went to fetch water went away from the water and will not return 
To the south the Elamites stepped in slaughtering   In the uplands the vandals the enemy   The Tidnum daily strapped the mace to their loins 
To the south the Elamites like an onrushing wave were   In the uplands like chaff blowing in the wind they  over the open country  Ur like a great charging wild bull bowed its neck to the ground 
Again he sent down the Elamites the enemy from the mountains  The foremost house firmly founded   In order to destroy Kisiga 1 men even five men  
Three days and three nights did not pass  the city was raked by a hoe  Dumuzid left Kisiga like a prisoner of war his hands were fettered  To the holy house  

She rode away from her possessions she went to the mountains  She loudly sang out a lament over those untravelled mountains  I am queen but I shall have to ride away from my possessions and now I shall be a slave in those parts 
I shall have to ride away from my silver and lapis lazuli and now I shall be a slave in those parts  There slavery  people who can  it  There slavery Elam  who can  it

Enlil threw open the door of the grand gate to the wind  Enlil threw open the door of the grand gate to the wind  In Ur no one went to fetch food no one went to fetch water 
Its people rushed around like water being poured from a well  Their strength ebbed away they could not even go on their way  Enlil afflicted the city with an evil famine 
He afflicted the city with that which destroys cities that which destroys houses  He afflicted the city with that which cannot be withstood with weapons  He afflicted the city with dissatisfaction and treachery 
Its people like fish being grabbed in a pond sought to escape  Its young and old lay spread about no one could rise  At the royal station  there was no food on top of the platform  
The king who used to eat marvellous food grabbed at a mere ration  As the day grew dark the eye of the sun was eclipsing the people experienced hunger  There was no beer in the beerhall there was no more malt for it 
There was no food for him in his palace it was unsuitable to live in  Grain did not fill his lofty storehouse he could not save his life  The grainpiles and granaries of Nanna held no grain 
Wine and syrup ceased to flow in the great dining hall  The butchers knife that used to slay oxen and sheep lay hungry  Its mighty oven no longer cooked oxen and sheep it no longer emitted the aroma of roasting meat 
The sounds of the bursag building the pure  of Nanna were stilled  The house which used to bellow like a bull was silenced  Its holy deliveries were no longer fulfilled its  were alienated 
The mortar pestle and grinding stone lay idle no one bent down over them  The Shining Quay of Nanna was silted up  The sound of water against the boats prow ceased there was no rejoicing 
The rushes grew the rushes grew the mourning reeds grew  Boats and barges ceased docking at the Shining Quay  Nothing moved on your watercourse which was fit for barges 
The plans of the festivals at the place of the divine rituals were altered  The boat with firstfruit offerings of the father who begot Nanna no longer brought firstfruit offerings  Its food offerings could not be taken to Enlil in Nibru 
Its watercourse was empty barges could not travel  There were no paths on either of its banks long grass grew there  The reed fence of the wellstocked cattlepen of Nanna was split open 
The cows and their young were captured and carried off to enemy territory  The munzerfed cows took an unfamiliar path in an open country that they did not know  Gayau who loves cows dropped his weapon in the dung 
unidug who stores butter and cheese did not store butter and cheese  Those who are unfamiliar with butter were churning the butter  Those who are unfamiliar with milk were curdling  the milk 
The sound of the churning vat did not resound in the cattlepen  Like mighty coals that once burnt its smoke is extinguished  The great dining hall of Nanna  
O father who begot me why have you turned away from my city which was built  for you  O Enlil why have you turned away from my Ur which was built  for you  The boat with firstfruit offerings no longer brings firstfruit offerings to the father who begot him 
Your food offerings can no longer be brought to Enlil in Nibru  The en priests of the countryside and city have been carried off by phantoms  Ur like a city raked by a hoe is to be counted as a ruinmound 
The Duur Enlils restingplace has become a haunted shrine  O Enlil gaze upon your city an empty wasteland  Gaze upon your city Nibru an empty wasteland 
The man who used to drill large wells scratches the ground in the market place  My father who begot me enclose in your embrace my city which is all alone  Enlil return to your embrace my Ur which is all alone 
Enclose in your embrace my Ekinugal which is all alone  May you bring forth offspring in Ur may you multiply its people  May you restore the divine powers of Sumer that have been forgotten

There is lamentation in the haunted city reeds of mourning grow there  1 ms adds 1 line In its midst there is lamentation reeds of mourning grow there  In its midst the people pass their days in sighing 
1 ms adds 1 line My son the noble son  why do you concern yourself with crying  Oh Nanna the noble son  why do you concern yourself with crying  The judgment uttered by the assembly cannot be reversed 
The word of An and Enlil knows no overturning  Ur was indeed given kingship but it was not given an eternal reign  From time immemorial since the Land was founded until people multiplied 
who has ever seen a reign of kingship that would take precedence for ever  The reign of its kingship had been long indeed but had to exhaust itself  O my Nanna do not exert yourself in vain abandon your city 
Then my king the noble son became distraught  Lord Aimbabbar the noble son grieved  Nanna who loves his city left his city 
Suen took an unfamiliar path away from his beloved Ur  In order to go as an exile from her city to foreign territory  Ningal quickly clothed herself and left the city 
The Anuna stepped outside of Ur   approached Ur  The trees of Ur were sick its reeds were sick 
Daily there was slaughter before it  Large axes were sharpened in front of Ur  The spears the arms of battle were prepared 
The large bows throwsticks and shields gathered together to strike  The barbed arrows covered its outer side like a raining cloud  Large stones fell toegether with great thuds 
1 ms adds 1 line Daily the evil wind returned in the city  Ur confident in its own strength stood ready for the murderers  Its people oppressed by the enemy could not withstand their weapons 
In the city those who had not been felled by weapons succumbed to hunger  Hunger filled the city like water it would not cease 
This hunger contorted peoples faces twisted their muscles  Its people were as if drowning in a pond they gasped for breath  Its king breathed heavily in his own palace 
Its people dropped their weapons their weapons hit the ground  They struck their necks with their hands and cried  They sought counsel with each other they searched for clarification 
Alas what can we say about it What more can we add to it  How long until we are finished off by this catastrophe  Inside Ur there is death outside it there is death 
In Ur the enemy oppresses us oh we are finished  In Ur the enemy oppresses us oh we are finished  The people took refuge  behind the city walls They were united in fear 
The palace that was destroyed by onrushing water was defiled its doorbolts were torn out  Elam like a swelling flood wave left  only the ghosts  In Ur weapons smashed heads like clay pots 
Its refugees were unable to flee they were trapped inside the walls  1 ms adds 3 lines Like fish living in a pond they tried to escape  The enemy seized the Ekinugal of Nanna 
They ripped out its heavy   The statues that were in the shrine were cut down  The great stewardess Ninigara ran away from the storehouse 
Its mighty cows with shining horns were captured their horns were cut off  Its unblemished oxen and grassfed sheep were slaughtered  1 ms adds 1 line They were cut down as date palms and were tied together 
The palmtrees strong as mighty copper the heroic strength  were torn out like rushes were plucked like rushes their trunks were turned sideways  Their tops lay in the dust there was no one to raise them 
The midribs of their palm fronds were cut off and their tops were burnt off  Their date spadices that used to fall  on the well were torn out  The fertile reeds which grew in the sacred  were defiled 
The great tribute that they had collected was hauled off to the mountains  The houses great door ornament fell down its parapet was destroyed 
The wild animals that were intertwined on its left and right  lay before it like heroes smitten by heroes  Its gapingmouthed dragons and its aweinspiring lions 
were pulled down with ropes like captured wild bulls and carried off to enemy territory  The fragrance of the sacred seat of Nanna formerly like a fragrant cedar grove was destroyed  1 ms adds 1 line Its architrave  gold and lapis lazuli 
The glory of the house whose glory was once so lovely was extinguished  Like a storm that fills all the lands it was built there like twilight in the heavens  its doors adorned with the heavenly stars 
its  Great bronze latches  were torn out  Its hinges  Together with its door fittings it  wept bitterly like a fugitive 
The bolt the holy lock and the great door were not fastened for it  The noise of the door being fastened had ceased  there was no one to fasten it 
The  and was put out in the square  The food offerings  of his royal dining place were altered  In its sacred place  the tigi em and ala instruments did not sound 
Its mighty tigi  did not perform its sacred song  There was no eloquence in the Dublama the place where oaths used to be taken  The throne was not set up at its place of judgment justice was not administered 
In the sacred bedchamber of Nanna musicians no longer played the balag drum  The sacred box that no one had set eyes upon was seen by the enemy  The divine bed was not set up it was not spread with clean hay 
The statues that were in the shrine were cut down  The cook the dream interpreter and the seal keeper did not perform the ceremonies properly  They stood by submissively and were carried off by the foreigners 
The priests of the holy uzga shrine and the sacred lustrations the linenclad priests  forsook the divine plans and sacred divine powers they went off to a foreign city  In his grief Suen approached his father 
O father who begot me how long will the enemy eye be cast upon my account how long   he lordship and the kingship that you bestowed   Father Enlil the one who advises with just words 
the wise words of the Land   your inimical judgment  look into your darkened heart terrifying like waves 
O Father Enlil the fate that you have decreed cannot be explained  as for my hairstyle  of lordship and the diadem with which I was crowned   he put on a garment of mourning 
My son the city built for you in joy and prosperity was given to you as your reign  Destroying the city overthrowing its great wall and battlements all this too is part of that reign   the black black days of the reign that has been your lot 
As for dwelling in your home the Etemenniguru that was properly built    indeed Ur shall be rebuilt in splendour the people shall bow down to you  There is to be bounty at its base there is to be grain 
There is to be splendour at its top the sun shall rejoice there  Let an abundance of grain embrace its table  May Ur the city whose fate was pronounced by An be restored for you 
May the land south and highland be organised for Nanna  May the roads of the mountains be set in order for Suen  Like a cloud hugging the earth they shall submit to him 
By order of An and Enlil it shall be conferred  Father Nanna came into his city of Ur with head raised high  The youth Suen could enter again into the Ekinugal 
Ningal refreshed herself in her sacred living quarters  1 ms adds 1 line In Ur she could enter again into her Ekinugal  4th kirugu 
There is lamentation in the haunted city mourning reeds grew there  In its midst there is lamentation mourning reeds grew there

O storm that destroys cities retreat O storm storm return to your home  O storm that destroys houses retreat O storm storm return to your home  Indeed the storm that blew on Sumer blew also on the foreign lands 
Indeed the storm that blew on the land blew on the foreign lands  It has blown on Tidnum it has blown on the foreign lands  It has blown on Gutium it has blown on the foreign lands 
It levelled Anan like a blowing evil wind  Famine has overwhelmed the evildoer those people will have to submit  May An not change the divine powers of heaven the divine plans for treating the people with justice 
May An not change the decisions and judgments to lead the people properly  To travel on the roads of the Land may An not change it  May An and Enlil not change it may An not change it 
May Enki and Ninma not change it may An not change it  That the Tigris and Euphrates should again carry water may An not change it  That there should be rain in the skies and on the ground speckled barley may An not change it 
That the marshes should support fish and fowl may An not change it  That old reeds and fresh reeds should grow in the reedbeds may An not change it  May An and Enlil not change it 
May Enki and Ninma not change it  That the orchards should bear syrup and grapes  that the high plain should bear the magurum tree 
that there should be long life in the palace  that the sea should bring forth every abundance may An not change it  The land densely populated from south to uplands may An not change it 
May Enki and Ninma not change it may An not change it  That cities should be rebuilt that people should be numerous  hat in the whole universe the people should be cared for 
O Nanna your kingship is sweet return to your place  May a good abundant reign be longlasting in Ur  Let its people lie down in safe pastures let them reproduce

After the cattle pen had been built for the foremost divine powers    how did it become a haunted place When will it be restored  Where once the brick of fate had been laid  
 who scattered its divine powers The lamentation is reprised  how did the storeroom of Nibru the shrine Duranki  become a haunted place When will it be restored 
After Kiur the great place had been built  after the brickwork of Ekur had been built  after Ubuukkena had been built 
 how did they become haunted When will they be restored  How did the true city become empty  Its precious designs have been defiled 
How were the citys festivals neglected  Its magnificent rites have been thrown into disorder  In the heart of Nibru where the divine powers were allotted 
and the blackheaded people prolificly multiplied  the citys heart no longer revealed any sign of intelligence    there where the Anuna used to give advice 
they no longer impart decisions or justice  Where its gods had established their dwellings  where their daily rations were offered their daises erected 
where the sacred royal offering  and the evening meal in their great banquet hall  were destined for the pouring out of choice beer and syrup    Nibru the city where in its spreading shade 
the blackheaded people used to cool themselves    in their dwellings Enlil fell upon them as if they were criminals  It was he who sent them scattering like a scattered herd of cattle 
How long until its lady the goddess Ninlil would ask after it  That great temple whose bustle of activity was famous  as though it were empty wasteland no one enters it 
As for all the great rulers who increased the wealth of the city of Nibru  why did they disappear  Where the blackheaded people ate rich grass like sheep  For how long would Enlil neglect that Land ears lamentation depression and despair 
How long would his spirit burn and his heart not be placated  Why were those who once played the em and ala drums  spending their time in bitter lamenting 
They were bewailing the hardship which beset them  The men whose wives had fallen whose children had fallen  were singing Oh our destroyed city 
Their city gone their homes abandoned    as those who were singing for the brick buildings of the good city  as the lamenters of wailing 
like the fosterchildren of an ecstatic no longer knowing their own intelligence  the people were smitten their minds thrown into disorder  The true temple wails bitterly 
built the temple Ninlil  Its gigigal  The true temple gave you only tears and lamentation  
 it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansingrites that are forgotten  The brickwork of Ekur gave you only tears and lamentation    it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansingrites that are forgotten  It weeps bitter tears over the splendid rites and most precious plans which are desecrated  
 its most sacred food rations neglected and  into funeral offerings it cries Alas  The temple despairs of its divine powers utterly cleansed pure hallowed which are now defiled  The true temple which it is bitter to enter on ones own 
passes the time renewing its tears  Because the sealings of the abundant materials stored in the temple have been broken open they have placed the loads on the ground  Because the property in its welltended storehouses has been sent back it says What will they weigh out for me now 
because the enemies who do not know good from evil have cut off all good things it sings a bitter dirge  because they have finished off its populace there like animals it cries Oh my Land  Because they have piled up the young women young men and their little children like heaps of grain it cries Woe for them 
Because they have splashed their blood on the ground like a rainstorm there is no restraint to its crying  The temple like a cow whose calf is cut off groans bitterly to itself  it is griefstricken and the sweetvoiced lamenters like nursemaids singing a lullaby respond tearfully with its name 
that he has looked away from it and toward a foreign land instead  The true temple of all the countries which had come before him   the blackheaded people who had taken a true path 
what have they done regarding what have they forsaken  that their lord has become enraged with them and walks in anger  2nd kirugu 
It voices bitter cries because he has removed the great divine powers from within it  Its gigigal  The citys lord who became angry with it 
Why did he cut off the road to its brickwork  He made the noisy pigeons fly away from their windows  Why did he transform the appearance of the temple which knew voices where they used to while away the days in sweet playing of tigi drums in the brick buildings 
The temple once a place to offer salutations in humility  is now as deathly silent as a temple which no one reveres  As though its purification priests equipment were not utterly sacred 
as though its cleansingrites did not bring calm in all countries  he has abandoned it turned his breast away from it  among dejection and lamentation he has made it a sacrilege 
He rejected it thus as though it were a blasphemy  Why has joy left its brickwork  Night and day he has filled its heart with tears 
Even now he has made it foreign and a sacrilege  Its lord who has despoiled it like an evil wind  has destroyed that city and its temples 
He has ripped out their foundations struck them with the adze  killed wives and their children within it  he has turned that city into a deserted city  
Its possessions have been carried off by the wind  Enlil turned the city which used to be there into a city no longer  He made its mind wander 
He threw its intelligence into disorder and made it haunted  He took away its food and its water  He brought to an end its days of familiarity with milk and with beer 
The temple which he has made a sacrilege utters bitter lamentations  he has made its eyes blurred with tears  The lamenters who perform the dirges 
The citys lord who has removed its divine powers   no one touches his arm no one intercedes  3rd kirugu 
How did Enlil make all his greatest divine powers fly away  No one ever touches his arm No one ever intercedes  Its gigigal 
To my dirge singer of bitter fates  I am going down and I shall weep tearfully to him  Even now the lamenters who are expert in song 
Now my people who are overcome by hardship  voice laments for me one by one  Even now the places of refuge of my people whose hearts are burning in dark distress 
have been made known to me  My people whose hearts have been broken on the bitter way  perform the lullabies of my young ones for me in tears 
The wellbuilt houses ladies dwellings  were falsely founded and they have been eroded by the winds  Of how the foe has finished off my Land 
They are addressing the cries of my heart overwhelmed with bitterness in order to soothe it  They are beginning their laments about my lord  He will have mercy and compassion on me  
Enlil father of the blackheaded people  he who will give the order to restore me  4th kirugu 
My heart is dark I am destroyed I am in chaos I have been devastated  Its gigigal  In the foremost brick buildings they sing that your fate is bitter 
weeping bitter tears of your own accord  speak supplications to your lord himself concerning what he did to you concerning that fate  My lord how long Look upon me with favour my lord 
Say Why   Say May your heart be soothed for me  overturn this sacrilege for your own good The day is   Say Reenter for me your dwelling in my darkened shrines 
Say Like a bright cleansed sacred day give  for your own good  Say   Say Your misfortunes  will rebuild it 
Depression has weakened your heart but I am the one who has established good cheer for you  He will fix it forever as your lot that you shall lift your head high  he will make good again the hostilities he is directing against you

Now see Enlil has fixed a good day in the land  He has even now ordered the day for Nibru to raise its neck to heaven  He himself has provided a good day for the Ekur to shine 
He himself has restored the day for Sumer and Akkad to expand  He himself has set aside the day for houses to be built and storerooms to be enclosed  He himself has brought out the day for seeds to sprout and living things to be born 
He has brought out the day for building cattle pens and founding sheepfolds  he ewes which bore lambs have filled the pens  Ewes have given birth in the folds their lambs have filled the pens 
The goats which bore kids have filled the folds  The ewes which flocked with their lambs have swelled the sheepfold  The goats which flocked with their kids have caused the pens to be widened 
He himself has set the day for turning destruction to the good  He has  the day  evil 
He has brought in ImeDagan as assistance for the day for establishing justice in the land  9th kirugu  Although Sumer and Akkad had been desecrated by the foe 
afterwards hearts were appeased spirits soothed  All the great gods thus had compassion  They looked upon those sunk in exhaustion and brought them up out of it 
They restored your city which had been razed to ruins  Its shining property which had been scattered which had been devastated  Enlil king of all countries restored it 
in Nibru the mountain of the greatest divine powers from where they had taken an unfamiliar path   at Enlils word the Anuna those very lords who determine the fates ordered that the temples which they had forsaken  and the jewels put there long ago which had been carried off by the wind 
should all be restored  He has established there dining in joy within  To ImeDagan his joyous reverent sacral officiant 
to sanctify its food to purify its water Enlil has given the command to him  He has commanded him to purify its defiled divine powers  He has put in order its disordered and scattered rites 
He decrees as a fate the offering of daily rations and the grinding up of fine meal and flour  He has decided to make bread plentiful on the table to make loaves numerous  1th kirugu 
A time when no one is to speak hostile words to another when a son is to respect his father  a time to establish humility in the Land for the inferior to be as important as the mighty  a time when the younger brother fearing his big brother is to show humility 
a time when the elder child is to treat the younger child reasonably and to pay heed to his words  a time to take neither weak nor strong away into captivity but to serve with great acts of good  time to travel the disordered roadways to extirpate evil growths 
a time when anyone is to go where they will to hurl no insults at ones fellow 
a time no one is to speak hostile words to another to perform no sacrilege  a time to remove bitterness from the Land to establish light therein  a time to remove bitterness from the Land to establish light therein 
a time when darkness is to be lifted in the Land so that living things should rejoice  Father Enlil the lord whose command cannot be altered prince of all countries  has fixed it among the blackheaded people and commanded for their benefit 
11th kirugu  Now see After that time Enlil the prince who is full of pity  has been beneficent to his hero who had laid the  brick 
He put in order again for him the divine powers which had been desecrated by the enemy  He sanctified again the defiled rites for him 
He purified its ziggurat temple and made it resplendent for him  Within he made abundance plentiful he filled it with choice beer and syrup  He established there at that time the pleasing of hearts the appeasing of spirits the ameliorating of moods 
ImeDagan himself stood in prayer to Enlil and offered salutations  When he had begun the lament and spoken the supplication  the prince of all countries treated his body with oil of abundance as if it were the sweetest syrup 
And his prayer was heard  Enlil looked upon him with favour  ImeDagan whose words bring Enlil pleasure  Enlils constant attendant with whose thoughts he agrees 
because he will entreat him in supplication and will do obeisance  because he will complete and honour the royal offering and will return  because he will keep watch over everything and will not be negligent 
Enlil has promised to ImeDagan his dominion of extended years  He promised him that he will be a man of preeminent kingship  He promised him that he will be a king whose reign is good 
He promised him that he shall have the people inhabit safe dwellings  Enlil found agreement in what he had said to the numerous people  On the day for decreeing fates every part of Sumer and Akkad 
will praise forever the majesty of the Great Mountain Nunamnir enkar weapon of the universe  It is his aweinspiring way  12th kirugu 
The  which had developed  its wiping clean  was to be accomplished   The  of heaven and earth put their divine powers  to sleep    mortal man multiplied to become as numerous as the gods 
 mortal man multiplied to become as numerous as the gods  When together  had achieved a momentous decision   the  of the gods  
Enki and Ninki determined the consensus   Enul and Ninul assigned the fate   When together An and Enlil had created it that one resembled  
When together Aruru Suen and Enki had fashioned its limbs  that one turned pitch black as at night halfway through the watch   All the great gods paled at its immensity and  was brought about 
Like a great wild bull which bellows mightily that one filled the world with its roar  As its gigantic horns reached up to heaven who trembled in his very core  As it was piled up over the mountains like a battlenet who turned away 
Who caused wailing and lamenting in those streets and   Uruk like a loyal citizen in terror set up an alarm  and exclaimed Rise up Why did its hand seize Uruk Why did the benevolent eye look away 
That one drew nearer That one settled upon the ground Why would he withdraw  Who distorted Uruks good sense and deranged its good counsel  Who smashed its good udug deity Who struck its good lamma deity too 
Who desecrated the fearsome radiance which crowned it  Who brought about mob panic in Uruk Who  sickness too  Along with the city the foreign lands  who  in the temple of Uruk 
Who made   Why was  expanded Who made the blackheaded people become so numerous 
Who overthrew    was destroyed  who restored   Who confronted

 each and every one    its ways were  
its destruction and demolition   The  of the gods  attention   who neglected  
 the city watched as the evil ghost approached   breathed painfully he wept bitterly   there was no nodding of the head 
A defiled hand smote him and flattened his skull  the city collapsed  The fearsome radiance overwhelmed like   The proud city of all the lands became like one who spreads havoc 
The faithful cowherds themselves overturned every single cattlepen  The chief shepherds themselves burned  every sheepfold  They built them up like grain heaps they spread them out like grain piles 
they were convulsed  they drenched the fields with water they turned the city into a swamp  They did all that Like reeds in a wasteland life could not be revived  They brought ruination Evil things menaced  the city 
Its good udug deities went away its lamma deities ran off  Its lamma deity said Hide in the open country and they took foreign paths  The citys patron god turned against it and its shepherd abandoned it 
Its guardian spirit though not an enemy was exiled  to a foreign place  Thus all its most important gods evacuated Uruk they kept away from it  They hid out in the hills and wandered  about in the haunted plains 
In the city built upon peace food and drink were overturned like a saman vessel  In the pasture lands a tumultuous noise arose the asses and sheep were driven away  Elderly people and babies taking their rest  in front  

He  and opened his clenched fist  He  and reached out his hand  The  of Sumer the city whose king crossed over to an enemy land 
to   he smote it with the might of his weapon  He  and turned the place into dust  He  and piled the people up in heaps

At its front war shall be a  axe at its rear it shall be a   Its overgrown hair shall be a harrow its back shall be flames  Its countenance shall be a malevolent storm that enshrouds heaven and earth 
The glint of its eyes shall be lightning that flashes far like the Anzud bird  Its mouth shall rage  a blazing fire that extends as far as the nether world  Its tongue shall be an inferno raining embers that sunders the Land 
Its ribs shall be crowbars that let light pass inside like the suns rays  Knotted at both its hips shall be citydestroying slingstones  Its great haunches shall be dripping knives covered with gore that make blood flow 
Its muscles shall be saws that slash its feet those of an eagle  It shall make the Tigris and Euphrates quaver it shall make the mountains rumble  At its reverberation the hills shall be uprooted the people shall be pitched about like sheaves 
Sumer and Akkad shall shiver they shall be flooded like a harvest crop  The foolish shall rejoice they shall exclaim   Let it come  we shall be seeing war and battle in the city 
how among the loyal families honest men are transformed into traitors  But the sensible shall beat their breasts and droop  their heads  At midnight they shall be afraid and tearful and suffer insomnia 
In bed under the covers they shall be unable to sleep soundly they shall wander about the city  They shall be immobilised their courage shall run out  May our allies serving in times of war raise their forces for peace 
May the word of Enlil be sent back may it turn tail  May the venom of Nunamnirs anger become exhausted  May those vicious men who have seized the Ekur be punished

They mutilated Sumer and Akkad they pulverised it as with a pestle  They destroyed its settlements and habitations they razed them to ruin mounds  The best of Sumer they scattered like dust they heaped up  
They destroyed the city of the Anuna gods they set it aflame  hey put out both Uruks eyes they uprooted its young shoots  They wandered all through the libation places of the Anuna gods 
And even Kulaba which is the primeval city they turned into a place of murder  4th kirugu  Alas  Sumer Alas  its people

They destroyed it they demolished it  Uruk the good place was  with dust 
Like a great wild bull wounded with an arrow   Like a wild cow pierced with a spear   The mighty one rushed with his weapons and  implements of war

He was taken to Ur the king of the Land was brought into the  house  The proud one lay in his palace  UrNamma he who was beloved by the troops could not raise his neck any more 
The wise one  lay down silence descended  As he who was the vigour of the Land had fallen the Land became demolished like a mountain  like a cypress forest it was stripped its appearance changed 
As if he were a boxwood tree they put axes against him in his joyous dwelling place  As if he were a sappy cedar tree he was uprooted in the palace where he used to sleep   His spouse  resting place 
His appointed time had arrived and he passed away in his prime  His  pleasing sacrifices were no longer accepted they were treated as dirty   The Anuna gods refused his gifts

 UrNamma alas what is it to me  To Arali the preeminent place of the Land  UrNamma the son of Ninsumun was brought in his prime 
The soldiers accompanying the king shed tears  their boat ie UrNamma was sunk in a land as foreign to them as Dilmun   was cut 
It was stripped of the oars punting poles and rudder which it had   its bolt was broken off   was put aside it stood  in saltpetre 
His donkeys were to be found with UrNamma they were buried with him  As he crossed over the  of the Land the Land was deprived of its ornament  The journey to the nether world is a desolate route 
Because of the king the chariots were covered over the roads were thrown into disorder no one could go up and down on them  ecause of UrNamma the chariots were covered over the roads were thrown into disorder no one could go up and down on them  He presented gifts to the seven chief porters of the nether world 
As the famous kings who had died  and the dead iib priests luma priests and nindigir priestesses all chosen by extispicy  announced the kings coming to the people a tumult arose in the nether world 
The king slaughtered numerous bulls and sheep  UrNamma seated the people at a huge banquet  The food of the nether world is bitter the water of the nether world is brackish 
The trustworthy shepherd knew well the rites of the nether world  so the king presented the offerings of the nether world  UrNamma presented the offerings of the nether world 
as many faultless bulls faultless kids and fattened sheep as could be brought  A mace a large bow with quiver and arrows an artfully made barbed dagger  and a multicoloured leather bag for wearing at the hip

and set up a dwelling place for him in the nether world  At the command of Erekigala  all the soldiers who had been killed by weapons 
were given into the kings hands  UrNamma was   so with Gilgame his beloved brother 
he will issue the judgments of the nether world and render the decisions of the nether world  After seven days 1 days had passed  lamenting for Sumer overwhelmed my king 
lamenting for Sumer overwhelmed UrNamma  That he could not complete the wall of Ur  that he could no longer enjoy the new palace he had built 
that he could no longer bring pleasure to his wife with his embrace  that he could not bring up his sons on his knees  that he would never see in their prime the beauty of their little sisters who had not yet grown up  
 my kings heart was full of tears he  bitterly  The trustworthy shepherd  a heartrending lament for himself  I who have been treated like this 
served the gods well set up chapels for them  I have created evident abundance for the Anuna gods  I have laid treasures on their beds strewn with fresh herbs 
Because of them anything that could have been a favourable portent for me was as far away from me as the heavens  the  What is my reward for my eagerness to serve during the days  My days have been finished for serving them sleeplessly during the night 
Now just as the rain pouring down from heaven cannot turn back  alas nor can I turn back to brickbuilt Ur  Alas my wife has become a widow  
She spends the days in tears and bitter laments  My strength has ebbed away   The hand of the fate demon  bitterly me the hero 
Like a wild bull   Like an offshoot   Like an ass  I died 
 my  wife   She spends the days in tears and bitter laments  Her kind protective god has left her 
her kind protective goddess does not care for her any more  Ninsumun no longer rests her august arm firmly on her head  Nanna Lord Aimbabbar no longer leads  her by the hand 
Her  has been silenced  she can no longer answer  She is cast adrift like a boat in a raging storm the mooring pole has not been strong enough for her  Like a wild ass lured  into a perilous pit she has been treated heavyhandedly 
Like a lion fallen into a pitfall a guard has been set up for her  Like a dog kept in a cage she is silenced  Utu  does not pay heed to the cries Oh my king overwhelming her 
My tigi adab flute and zamzam songs have been turned into laments because of me  The instruments of the house of cantorship have been propped against the wall  Instead of my throne whose beauty was endless 
Instead of my bed the sleeping place whose  was endless  I have been made to lie down in the open desolate steppe  My wife and my children are in tears and wailing 
My people whom I used to command  sing like lamentation  and dirge singers because of her   While I was so treated foremost inanna the warlike lady was not present at my verdict 
Enlil had sent her as a messenger to all the foreign lands concerning very important matters  When she had turned her gaze away from there  inanna humbly entered the shining Ekur 
Then Enlil said Great lady of the Eana once someone has bowed down he cannot   any more  the trustworthy shepherd left Eana you cannot see him any more  My lady  among the people  
hen inanna the fierce storm the eldest child of Suen   made the heavens tremble made the earth shake  inanna destroyed cattlepens devastated sheepfolds saying 
I want to hurl insults at An the king of the gods  Who can change the matter if Enlil elevates someone  Who can change the import of the august words uttered by An the king 
there will be no abundance at the godss place of sunrise  My holy gipar the shrine Eana has been barred up like  a mountain  If only my shepherd could enter before me in it in his prime  I will not enter it otherwise 
If only my strong one could grow for me like greenery in the desert  If only he could hold steady for me like a river boat at its calm mooring  This is how inanna gave vent  to a lament over him 
Lord Ningizida   UrNamma my  who was killed  Among tears and laments  
 decreed a fate for UrNamma  UrNamma  your august name will be called upon  From the south to the uplands  the holy sceptre 
Sumer  to your palace  The canals which you have dug the  which you have   the large and grand arable tracts which you have

My king    among tears and laments 
 frowned at    the day was full of sorrow   withdrew into his bedchamber and lay down fasting 
The mother wretched  because of her son    the mother of the king holy Ninsumun was crying Oh my heart  That the fate of UrNamma had been overturned 
and that the trustworthy shepherd had been made to pass away  she was weeping bitterly in the broad square which is otherwise a place of entertainment  She spent the day in lamentation over the trustworthy shepherd who had been snatched away 
Sweet sleep did not  come to the people whose happiness had come to an end  As the early flood was filling the canals their canalinspector   The mottled barley come forth on the arable lands the life of the land  
To the farmer the fertile fields   Enkimdu the lord of levees and ditches    its numerous people

As he the cedar tree of the Land was uprooted the state of the Land became altered  Axes  were set against him a boxwood tree in his joyous dwelling place  His appointed time arrived and he passed away in his prime 
His  pleasing sacrifices were no longer accepted they were treated as dirty   The Anuna gods did not reach out for his gifts any more   did not stand by an It is enough his  days were not prolonged

after I nobly ascended the royal throne I mustered my chariotry and extensive troops  Inaccessible fortresses round about I conquered As tribute of horses  
from the land Gilzanu I received  Because horses in hither to me were not continually brought I became angry  and to the cities arira and algalaus which were under the authority of the guilty rulers I marched 
Those I conquered in the eponymy of Assurnasirpal Their property booty  possessions and herds I took out and to my city Assur brought The great  city together with its people  
to Assur my god   and my lord I dedicated   I conquered  Lords

To Lugalme3x  Xinanna the eridingir priestess of Inanna  for Lugalux  
To Gilgamesh  did Nimgireatum  dedicate it 
Property  of the goddess Lamma 
On the mountain range spanning both heaven and earth  When An fathered the Anuna gods  Because no one had been able to give birth to or create Anan yet 
Because the flax of the weaving goddess Uttu had not been created along with them  Because the pegs of the loom had not been set for Uttu  Because the ewe had not come forth the lamb had not multiplied 
Because the goat had not come forth the kid had not multiplied  Because the ewe had not given birth to its lamb  Because the goat had not given birth to its kid 
The Anuna the great gods did not know  The mu barley of the thirtieth day was not present  The mu barley of the fortieth day was not present 
The mu barley of the fiftieth day was not present  The small barley the barley of the mountain the barley of the pure settlement was not present  Wearing of garments was not present 
Uttu was not yet born the crown was not yet raised  Lord Bridegroom Dumuzi and Kalkal the gatekeeper of the Ekur were not yet born  Sumuqan had not yet come out in the dry land 
They did not know that food was to be eaten  They did not know the wearing of garments  In the land one wentstood on limbs ie on all fours naked 
Like sheep one ate with grass in its mouth ie ruminated  They were drinking water in the ditches  At that time at the place of forming features of the gods 
In their temple on the Holy Mound  was creating lahar and Ezina  They gathered them into the shrine where the gods ate food  The abundance of lahar and Anan 
Humanity   At that time Enki spoke to Enlil 
Father Enlil both lahar and Ezina  Becauseafter created them on the Holy Mound  We shall send them down from the Holy Mound 
This is how both Enki and Enlil spoke in their holy conversation  They were sending down both lahar and Ezina from the Holy Mound  They were enclosing lahar in her sheepfold 
For Ezina they were putting down a fertile field  They were giving to her the plow the yoke and its plow team  After lahar stood in the sheepfold 
After the shepherd furnished her with allure in the sheepfold  After Ezina stood in the furrow  She was a beautifulverdant young woman bearing allure 
After she raised her fertile head in the field  After she was poured upon by the abundance of heaven  Both lahar and Ezina appeared 
In the land life force was there for them  They were properly executing the me of the gods  They were making things proliferate in the storehouse of the land 
Into the prison founded in the dust  After they entered abundance was there for them  The two of them lit their two where they set their feet 
They are the ones who increase things in the house heavily  Where they stand they are correct where they sit they are appropriate  They are ones that are pleasant in the heart of An and the heart of Enlil

When I was going when I was going  When I the almighty lady of all mankind   I am the lady  was going to the Abzu 
When I  I am the lady of heaven  was going to the Abzu  When I was going to the Abzu the princely house  When I was going to sweet Eridu 
When I was going to the HouseoftheSweetWaters  When I was going to the HouseofHeaven the house of Enlil  When I was going to where the firstfruit offerings are brought in daily 
When I was going to where jars have been offered by a pure hand  When I was going to where the righteous man raised his hand  When I was going to where the lord Enki raised his hand 
When I was going to where Damgalnuna raised her hand  When I was going to where Asar in the Abzu raised his hand  then I brought a dog along with me I brought a lion along with me 
I brought boxwood along with me I brought halubwood along with me  I am the LadyofHeaven I accepted the breezes  When I bring it along with me when I bring it along with me 
When I  I am the lady  was strolling about the marshes  I am indeed the arabubird of the marshes  When I was going at the opening of the battle 
I am forthcoming daydaydaylight  When I am going in front of the battle  I am forthcoming daydaylight 
When I was following the battle  I am devastation that rose up wickedly  When I was entering the house of Enlil 
Against the mountain ranges I speak angry words  My husband took his place in front of me  Against the house against Utu they take part in combat 
Against Utu and Nanna they take part in combat  Against Sud the one with the water of the holy dish they take part in combat  On the river on the river like sailing on the river  like the spouse sweet like the town sweet such a sweet thing does not exist  
On the river on the Princecanal like sailing on the river  On the river on the Euphrates like sailing on the river  On the course of the Euphrates like sailing on the river 
Like the deity of mankind went with her  Like the spouse sweet like the town sweet such a sweet thing does not exist  Like Enki the wild bull of the sweet town went with her 
Like the mother of the Emah Damgalnuna went with her  Like Asarlui the child of the sweet town went with her  Like Enlil ate and like he drank  like the spouse sweet like the town sweet such a sweet thing does not exist 
 my heart is placed  To the house where the righteous man raised his hand  To that house where the righteous man raised his hand 
In the HouseofHeaven the linenclad erected a stone for him  Addressing the lord water was prepared  Addressing him bread was prepared 
They are telling him to refresh in the palace  O Dumuzi it is in the house a place bright as a day it is  Mother Inanna Mother Inanna your hill your going 
Mother Inanna InannaofHeaven your clothes your clothes  Your black clothes your white clothes  It is indeed my man who strolled around the house 
Its me it is indeed They shall place the me  Its place it is indeed They shall set the proper place  They shall place him they shall place him 
They shall place Enlil in the kiur  O lord life of the land I will revive that man  I will make things alone things alone 
For its men I will make a firm promise in the cella  Whatever it is that you say as firm promise in the rear part of the palace  O Inanna your breast is indeed your field 
When you poured out flax in the wide field  When you poured out barley in the wide field  Then draw water from there and establish it for the men 
Draw much water from there and establish it plentifully for the men  After you have told it the man addressed  I will drink that on your behalf 
Did you see the man who struck and dislodged the mastmooring poleloom peg How is he found there  He says Now someone should say to my mother his torn out dislocated rib ie boat planking let the water pour in  The supporting beam crumbling like breads crumbs destroyed him with water 
Did you see the man who had fallen from the roof How is he found there  He  like an ox eaten by parasites  Did you see the man who was overtaken by the curse of his mother and father How is he found there 
Did you see the man who was overtaken by the curse of his mother and father How is he found there  His heir has absconded from him his ghost roams around  Did you see the man who was intent to not respect the command of his mother and father How is he found there 
His food is set aside his water is set aside  He is eating  food he is drinking  water 
He is eating  food he is drinking  water  Did you see the man who fell in battle How is he found there  There his father and mother do not grasp his head his wife weeps 
Did you see the man whose corpse lies in the plain  How is he found there  Did you see the man whose corpse lies in the plain  How is he found there   apart from  
Did you see the ghost that does not have someone to provide funerary offerings for him I saw him How is he treated  Did you see the ghost that does not have someone to provide funerary offerings for him I saw him How is he treated   he eats his bread crumbs that have fallen into the street 
Did you see the tiny stillborn babies who do not know their own names How are they found there  Did you see the tiny stillborn babies who do not know their own names How are they found there  They play in a troughbucket of gold and silver filled with honey and ghee 
In those days in those distant days  in those nights in those remote nights  in those years in those distant years 
in days of yore when the necessary things had been brought into manifest existence  in days of yore when the necessary things had been for the first time properly cared for  when bread had been tasted for the first time in the shrines of the Land 
when the ovens of the Land had been made to work  when the heavens had been separated from the earth  when the earth had been delimited from the heavens 
when An had taken the heavens for himself  when Enlil had taken the earth for himself  when the nether world had been given to Erekigal as a gift 
when he set sail when he set sail  when the father set sail for the nether world  when Enki set sail for the nether world 
against the king a storm of small hailstones arose  against Enki a storm of large hailstones arose  The small ones were light hammers 
The keel of Enkis little boat  as if it were being butted by turtles was trembling  against the king the waves at the bow of the boat 
like wolves were eating together  against Enki the waves at the stern of the boat  like a lion were attacking 
At that time there was a single tree a single alub tree a single tree  growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates  being watered by the Euphrates 
and the Euphrates picked it up and carried it away  A woman respectful of Ans words was walking along  respectful of Enlils words was walking along 
and took the tree and into Unug  into Inannas luxuriant garden brought it  The woman planted the tree not with her hands but with her feet 
The woman planted the tree not with her hands but with her feet planted it  When will this be a luxuriant chair on which I can take a seat she said  When this will be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down she said 
the tree grew massive its bark however did not split  At its roots a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest  In its branches the Anzud bird settled its young 
In its trunk the phantom maid built herself a dwelling  the maid who laughs with a joyful heart  But silver Inanna cried 
When dawn was breaking when the horizon became bright  when the little birds at the break of dawn began to clamor  when Utu had left his bedchamber 
to the young warrior Utu said  My brother in those days when destiny was determined  when abundance overflowed in the Land 
when An had taken the heavens for himself  when Enlil had taken the earth for himself  when the nether world had been given to Erekigala as a gift 
when he set sail when he set sail  when the father set sail for the nether world  when Enki set sail for the nether world 
against Enki a storm of large hailstones arose  The small ones were light hammers  the large ones were like stones from catapults  
The keel of Enkis little boat was trembling  as if it were being butted by turtles  against the lord the waves at the bow of the boat 
like wolves together were eating  against Enki the waves at the stern of the boat were attacking Enki like a lion  like a lion were attacking 
growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates  being watered by the Euphrates  The force of the south wind uprooted it and stripped its branches 
and the Euphrates picked it up and carried it away  I a woman respectful of Ans words was walking along  respectful of Enlils words was walking along 
and took the tree and brought it into Unug  into silver Inannas luxuriant garden  I the woman planted the tree not with my hands but with my feet 
When will this be a luxuriant chair on which I can take a seat  When will this be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down she said  5 years 1 years had gone by 
the tree had grown massive its bark however did not split  At its roots a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest  In its branches the Anzu bird settled its young 
In its trunk the phantom maid built herself a dwelling  the maid who laughs with a joyful heart  But silver Inanna cried 
When dawn was breaking when the horizon became bright  when the little birds at the break of dawn began to clamor  when Utu had left his bedchamber 
his sister silver Inanna  to the warrior Gilgame speaks  My brother in those days when destiny was determined 
when abundance overflowed in the Land  when An had taken the heavens for himself  when Enlil had taken the earth for himself 
when he set sail when he set sail  when the father set sail for the nether world  when Enki set sail for the nether world 
against the lord a storm of small hailstones arose  against Enki a storm of large hailstones arose  The small ones were light hammers 
the large ones were like stones from catapults   The keel of Enkis little boat  as if it were being butted by turtles was trembling 
like wolves rose to devour  against Enki the waves at the stern of the boat  like a lion were attacking 
At that time there was a single tree a single alub tree a single tree   growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates  being watered by the Euphrates 
The force of the south wind uprooted it and stripped its branches  and the Euphrates picked it up and carried it away  I a woman respectful of Ans words was walking along 
and took the tree and brought it into Unug  into Inannas luxuriant garden  The woman planted the tree not with her hands but with her feet 
Inanna watered it using not her hands but her feet  When will this be a luxuriant chair on which I can take a seat she said  When will this be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down she said 
5 years 1 years had gone by  the tree had grown massive its bark however did not split  At its roots a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest 
In its trunk the phantom maid built herself a dwelling  the maid who laughs with a joyful heart  I silver Inanna cried 
In the matter which his sister had told him about  her brother the warrior Gilgamesh stood by her  to his waist his  belt of 5 minas weight he strapped 
5 minas were to him as 3 shekels  His bronze axe used for expeditions  which weighs 7 talents and 7 minas in his hand he took 
The Anzu bird living in its branches took up its young and went into the mountains  The phantom maid living in its trunk left  her dwelling  and sought refuge in the wilderness 
As for the tree he uprooted it and stripped its branches  and the sons of his city who went with him  cut up its branches and bundled them 
He gave it to his sister silver Inanna for her chair  He gave it to her for her bed  As for himself from its roots he manufactured his ball  
He played with the ball  in the broad square never wanting to stop playing it  and he praised himself in the broad square never wanting to stop praising himself  The young men of his city were playing with the ball  
For  him who made the team of the widows children   they lamented O my neck O my hips  For those that had a mother bread for her son she brought 
for those that had a sister she poured water for her brother  As the evening came  he marked the spot where the ball  had been placed 
and he picked up his ball  from in front of him and took it home  But early in the morning as he  the place marked 
the widows accusation  and the young girls complaint  caused his ball  and his mallet  to fall down to the bottom of the nether world 
He could not reach them by   He tried with his hand but could not reach them  tried with his foot but could not reach them 
At the gate of Ganzer in front of the nether world he sat down  Gilgamesh wept crying bitterly  O my ball  O my mallet  
My ball  I am still not satiated with its charms  the game with it has not yet palled for me 
If only my ball  waited still in the carpenters house for me  I would treat the carpenters wife like my own mother  I would treat the carpenters child like my little sister 
My ball  has fallen down to the nether worldwho will retrieve it for me  My mallet  has fallen down to Ganzerwho will retrieve it for me  His servant Enkidu answered 
My king you weep why does your heart worry  Today I shall retrieve your ball  from the nether world  I shall retrieve your mallet  from Ganzer 
If today you are going to go down to the nether world  let me advise you My instructions should be followed  Let me talk to you Pay attention to my words 
You should not put on your clean garments  they would recognise immediately that you are alien  You should not anoint yourself with fine oil from a bowl 
they would surround you at its scent  You should not hurl throwsticks in the nether world  those struck down by the throwsticks would surround you 
the spirits would feel insulted by you  You should not put sandals on your feet  You should not shout in the nether world 
You should not kiss your beloved wife  You should not hit your wife even if you are annoyed with her  You should not kiss your beloved child 
You should not hit your son even if you are annoyed with him  The outcry aroused would detain you in the nether world  She who lies there she who lies there 
her pure shoulders are not covered with a garment  and no linen is spread over her pure breast  She has fingers like a pickaxe 
she plucks her hair out like leeks  Enkidu however did not heed not his masters words  He put on his clean garments 
and they recognised that he was alien  He anointed himself with fine oil from a bowl  and they surrounded him at its scent 
and those struck down by the throwsticks surrounded him  He held a cornelwood stick in his hand  and the spirits felt insulted by him 
He put sandals on his feet  He caused irritation in the nether world  He kissed his beloved wife 
and hit his wife when he was annoyed with her  He kissed his beloved child  and hit his son when he was annoyed with him 
The warrior Gilgamesh son of Ninsumun  directed his steps on his own to Ekur the temple of Enlil  He cried before Enlil 
Father Enlil my ball  fell down into the nether world my mallet  fell down into Ganzer  Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him  Namtar did not seize him the Asag did not seize him but the nether world has seized him 
The udug demon of Nergal who spares nobody did not seize him but the nether world has seized him  He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood but the nether world has seized him  Father Enlil did not stand by him in the matter so he went to Eridu 
He cried before Enki  Father Enki my ball  fell down into the nether world my mallet  fell down into Ganzer  Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him 
Namtar did not seize him the Asag did not seize him but the nether world has seized him  The udug demon of Nergal who spares nobody did not seize him but the nether world has seized him  He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood but the nether world has seized him 
Father Enki stood by him in this matter  He said to the young warrior Utu the son born by Ningal  Open a window in the nether world immediately 
He opened a window in the nether world  and brought up his servant with his breeze  from the nether world  They hugged and kissed 
They wearied each other with questions  Did you see the order of the nether world  If only you would tell me my friend if only you would tell me 
If I tell you the order of the nether world  si yourself down and weep I shall sit down and weep   which your heart rejoiced to touch 
worms infest it like an old garment   like  of  a crevice it is full of dust  Alas he said and sat down in the dust 
Did you see him who had 1 son I saw him How does he fare  He weeps bitterly at the wooden peg which was driven into his wall  Did you see him who had 2 sons I saw him How does he fare 
He sits on 2 bricks eating bread  Did you see him who had 3 sons I saw him How does he fare  He drinks water from a saddle waterskin 
His heart rejoices like a man who has four asses to yoke  Did you see him who had 5 sons I saw him How does he fare  Like a good scribe he is indefatigable he enters the palace easily 
Did you see him who had 6 sons I saw him How does he fare  He is a cheerful as a ploughman  Did you see him who had 7 sons I saw him How does he fare 
As a companion of the gods he sits on a throne and listens to judgments  Did you see the palace eunuch I saw him How does he fare  Like a useless alala stick he is propped in a corner 
Like a  pot she is thrown away violently she gives no man joy  Did you see the young man who never undressed his wife I saw him How does he fare  You finish a rope and he weeps over the rope 
Did you see the young woman who never undressed her husband I saw her How does she fare  You finish a reed mat and she weeps over the reed mat  Did you see him who had no heir I saw him How does he fare 
Like him who  bricks  he eats bread   I saw him How does he fare 
Did you see   His food is set apart his water is set apart he eats the food offered  to him he drinks the water offered  to him 
Did you see him who was eaten by a lion  He cries bitterly O my hands O my legs  Did you see him who fell down from the roof 
They cannot  his bones  Did you see the leprous man  He twitches like an ox as the worms eat at him 
His father and mother are not there to hold his head and his wife weeps  Did you see the spirit of him who has no funerary offerings I saw him How does he fare  He eats the scraps and the crumbs  tossed out in the street 
Did you see him hit by a ships board How does he fare  Did you see him hit by a ships board How does he fare 
Alas my mother the man cries to her  as he pulls out the ships board   he  cross beam  crumbs 
Did you see my little stillborn children who never knew existence I saw them How do they fare  They play at a table of gold and silver laden with honey and ghee  Did you see him who died  I saw him How does he fare 
He lies on a bed of the gods  Did you see him who was set on fire I did not see him  His spirit is not about His smoke went up to the sky

Were properly conveying the monthly nindaba offerings and the nindaba offerings of the new year  At the gate of Agade exhaustion was placed  Holy Inanna did not know how to accept the nindaba offering anymore 
Aslike a citizen the temple to be founded did not satisfy her  The matterword of the Ekur engendered dazed silence  Trembling lingered for Inanna in Agade 
In Ulma Inanna was afraid  She went out from the city into her original place of dwelling  The young woman as if to abandon that of her womens quarters 
Holy Inanna abandoned the shrine of Agade  Like a warrior advancing against the weapon  She imposed battle and combat apart from the city 
She beat the breast for the enemy instead  It was not before the elapse of five days it was not before the elapse of ten days  The bindings of the enship the crown of kingship 
He bound his hands towards the Ekur temple  He acted towards the giguna like it was worth a mere thirty gig 
He acted towards the giguna like it was worth a mere thirty gig  Like a male thief who plunders a city  He gathered upimposed great ladders for use against the temple 
In order to destroy the Ekur temple like a great boat  In order to loosen its soil like a mountain mined for precious metal  As if to cutseparate it like the mountain range of lapis lazuli 
In order bring its neck to the ground like a city that Ikur had poured upon  Although the temple was not inof the mountain of the cut juniper  He brought great hazin axes towards it 
month Harvest  month Harvest  year The ShuSuen king of Ur the boat named IbexofAbzu caulked 
The gakkul vat the gakkul vat  The gakkul vat the lamsare vat   The gakkul vat that puts us in a happy mood 
The lamsare vat that makes the stomach rejoice  The ugurbala jar glory of the house  The agub jar filling with beer 
The amam jar that carries the beer from the lamsare vat  The troughs of bur grass and the pails for kneading the dough  All the beautiful vessels are ready on their pot stands  
Let the eye of the gakkul vat be our eye   and let the stomach of the gakkul vat be our heart  What makes your stomach feel wonderful in itself  
also makes our stomachs feel wonderful in themselves  We are in a happy mood our stomachs are joyful  You have poured a libation over the brick of fate 
and you have laid the foundations in peace and prosperity  now may Ninkasi dwell with you   She should transfer one to the other beer and wine for you  
In the troughs of bur grass there is sweet beer   I will have the cupbearers the boys and the brewers stand by  As I spin around the lake of drinks 
while feeling wonderful feeling wonderful  while drinking beer in a blissful mood  while drinking alcohol and feeling exhilarated 
with joy in the stomach and a contented liver  my stomach is a heart stomach with joy  I clothe my contented liver in a garment fit for a queen 
The seal with the inscription of Urdun the merchant has gone lost  By word of the assembly  the herald in the streets sounded the trumpet 
No one may hold him liable for anything  LuSuen the general  Lugalmelam the cityruler 
Zuzu the headmaster  Zuzu the headmaster  Sidu the scribe 
Adlub the steward  Bansage the lamentationpriest and temple administrator 
After you speak to my king  To my ram of the mountain range with beautiful horns  Horse of the mountain range with claws of an eagle 
Date palm grown in a pure place from which shining dates hang down  After you repeat to him  For Abaindasa the overseer of the arrayed troops 
he who by delighting his king pleases the heart of his king  Your servant thus says  I am powerful the soldier of my king 
When the boat is idle I prepare the oars  When the water is standing still I can make it flow  When the wind is still I prepare the grain 
When  I illuminate   When the water is still I make it flow  As a scribe I incise a stele 
the words of the army I    I am able to reproduce the dropped and excised words of the assembly  the sweet words copies   
But now as if I was planted like a tree in my forest I bend over as one who is dirty  The one who is near to the royal throne has bound my hands with rope  In my city I the one who wore a clean garment now wears a dirty garment 
As one who has washed with mud clods I caked dirt to serve as facial makeup  A dog that has eaten carrion has also retreated 
An uumgal creature that kills has also left behind scraps  After the reedbed is consumed by fire the ponds remain  After Utu has consumed ghee has consumed cheese he touches the churn to make it more productive 
I have brought out my lifebreath take hold of my hand  I am the child of a widow one who has not had anyone to inquire after him  as for me when will the heart of ulgi my king be returned to its place on my behalf 
To my lord the bull with sparkling eyes a beard of lapislazuli sporting  speak  To my golden statue on a favorable day born
to my water buffalo in a holy fold reared in the silverstomach of Inanna chosen to my lord the trusted one of Inanna repeat  You are fashioned like the son of An 
your utterances like the words of a god are irrevocable your utterances like rain pouring from the skies are uncountable  this is what Ursaga your servant says 
If my lord agrees my fathers household let no one carry off  my fathers household let no one take away 
Messenger messenger to my mother  say  what monkey says 
Ur is the city resplendent of Nanna   In Eridu the city abundant of Enki   indeed I behind the door of the house of the Chief Musician am sitting 
Looks are feeding me  May I not die  There being no fresh bread there being no fresh beer 
Its a flood 


At his command your weapon struck me evilly  As I let the divine powers go out of my hand these divine powers returned to the abzu  As I let the divine plan go out of my hand this divine plan returned to the abzu 
This tablet of destinies returned to the abzu I was stripped of the divine powers  Ninurta was stunned at these words of the Anzuchick  Ninmena gave out a wail 
And what about me These divine powers have not fallen into my hand  I shall not exercise their authority I shall not live  like him in the shrine in the abzu  Father Enki in the abzu knew what had been said 
and drew near with him to Enkis place the abzu  The Anzuchick returned Utaulu to the abzu  The lord was delighted with the hero 
Father Enki was delighted with the hero Ninurta  Lord Nudimmud honored him duly  Hero no god among your brother gods could have acted so 
As for the bird which your mighty weapon captured  from now to eternity you will keep your foot placed on its neck  May the great gods give your heroic strength its due 
May Ninmena not fashion your equal   May no one be as revered as you and no god extend an upraised hand before you  Monthly may your house  regularly receive tributes in the shrine in the abzu 
May An  proclaim your name in the seat of honor  The hero secretly was not happy with these promises  Where he stood he darkened and yellowed like  a floodstorm  
He contemplated great deeds and inwardly he was rebellious  He uttered a word which has no   The hero Ninurta set his sights on the whole world 
The great lord Enki intuitively grasped the substance of the plan  In the shrine in the abzu he stirred up a dark floodstorm  By the house the minister Isimud opposed Ninurta 
The hero Ninurta refused to come out  and raised his hand against the minister Isimud  Against Ninurta Enki fashioned a turtle from the clay of the abzu 
Against him he stationed the turtle at an opening at the gate of the abzu  Enki talked to him near the place of the ambush  and brought him to the place where the turtle was 
The hero Ninurta managed to turn back its feet  Enki as if perplexed said What is this  He had the turtle scrape the ground with its claws had it dig an evil pit 
The hero Ninurta fell into it with the turtle  The hero did not know how to get out from   The turtle kept on gnawing his feet with its claws  
The great lord Enki said to him  From  you who set your mind to kill me   who makes big claims 
You who set your sights on me like this  what has your position seized for you how   Where has your strength fled Where is your heroism 
In the great mountains you caused destruction but how will you get out now  Ninmena learned of this situation  She was ripping the clothes from her body she   
My ugplanteater Enki whom shall I send to you  Men will shake their heads in fear  whom shall I send to you  That name is not Enki That name is Uguguthatdoesnotpour  
In those remote days when the fates were determined  in a year when An brought about abundance  and people broke through the earth like green plants  
then the lord of the abzu King Enki  Enki the lord who determines the fates  built up his temple entirely from silver and lapis lazuli 
Its silver and lapis lazuli were the shining daylight  Into the shrine of the abzu he brought joy  An artfully made bright crenellation rising out from the abzu 
He built the temple from precious metal decorated it with lapis lazuli  and covered it abundantly with gold  In Eridu he built the house on the bank 
Its brickwork makes utterances and gives advice  Its eaves roar like a bull  the temple of Enki bellows 
During the night the temple praises its lord and offers its best for him  Before Lord Enki Isimud the minister praises the temple  he goes to the temple and speaks to it 
Temple built from precious metal and lapis lazuli  whose foundation pegs are driven into the abzu  which has been cared for by the prince in the abzu 
Like the Tigris and the Euphrates it is mighty and aweinspiring   Joy has been brought into Enkis abzu  Your lock has no rival 
Your bolt is a fearsome lion  Your roof beams are the bull of heaven an artfully made bright headgear  Your reedmats are like lapis lazuli decorating the roofbeams 
Your door is a lion who seizes a man  Your stairway is a lion coming down on a man  Abzu pure place which fulfils its purpose 
Eengura Your lord has directed his steps towards you  Enki lord of the abzu  has embellished your foundation pegs with cornelian 
He has adorned you with  and  lapis lazuli  The temple of Enki is provisioned with silver wax   it is a bull obedient to its master 
Eengura which Enki has surrounded with a silver reed fence  In your midst a lofty throne is erected  your doorjamb is the silver locking bar of heaven 
Abzu pure place place where the fates are determined  the lord of wisdom Lord Enki  Enki the lord deciding fates 
Nudimmud the lord of Eridu  lets nobody look into its midst  Your abgal priests let their hair down their backs 
Enkis beloved Eridu  Eengura whose inside is full of abundance 
Abzu life of the Land beloved of Enki  Temple built on the edge befitting the artful divine powers  Eridu your shadow extends over the midst of the sea 
Eridu your shadow extends over the midst of the sea Rising sea without a rival  mighty aweinspiring river which terrifies the Land  Eengura high citadel  standing firm on the earth 
Temple at the edge of the engur a lion in the midst of the abzu  lofty temple of Enki which bestows wisdom on the Land  your cry like that of a mighty rising river 
To his silver house its goodness he sets  the lyre the algar instrument the balag drum  the arar the sabitum and the  miritum instruments offer their best for his silver temple 
The  with a sweet sound  resounded by themselves  The silver algar instrument of Enki played for him on his own 
and seven tigi drums resounded  What Enki says is irrefutable   is well established  
he praised the Eengura with sweet songs  As it has been built as it has been built  as Enki has raised Eridu up 
it is an artfully built mountain which floats on the water  His shrine  spreads  out into the reedbeds  In its green orchards laden with fruit 
birds brood  The suhur carp play among the honeyherbs  and the esztub carp dart among the small gizi reeds 
He has the abzu stand as a marvel  as he brings joy into the engur  Like the sea he is aweinspiring 
like a mighty river he instils fear  The Euphrates rises before him as it does before the fierce south wind  His punting pole is Nirah 
his oars are the small reeds  When Enki embarks the year will be full of abundance  The ship departs of its own accord with tow rope held  by itself 
the river gurgles  to its lord  its sound is a calfs mooing the mooing of a good cow  Enki had oxen slaughtered and had sheep offered there lavishly 
Where there were no ala drums he installed some in their places  where there were no bronze ub drums he despatched some to their places  He directed his steps on his own to Nibru 
and entered the temple terrace the shrine of Nibru  Enki reached for  the beer he reached for  the liquor  He had liquor poured into big bronze containers 
In kukuru containers which make the beer good he mixed beermash  By adding datesyrup to its taste  he made it strong  He  its branmash 
In the shrine of Nibru Enki  provided a meal for Enlil his father  He seated An at the head of the table 
and seated Enlil next to An  He seated Nintur in the place of honour  and seated the Anuna gods at the adjacent places  
They filled the bronze aga vessels to the brim  and started a competition drinking from the bronze vessels of Urasz  They made the tilimda vessels shine like silver barges 
After beer and liquor had been libated and enjoyed  and after  from the house  Enlil was made happy in Nibru 
Enlil addressed the Anuna gods  Great gods who are standing here  Anuna who have lined up in the Ubszuunkena 
He has made Eridu rise up  from the ground like a mountain  He has built it in a pleasant place  in Eridu the pure place where no one is to enter 
a temple built with silver and decorated with lapis lazuli  a house which tunes the seven tigi drums properly and provides incantations  where silver songs make all of the house a lovely place 
the shrine of the abzu the good destiny of Enki befitting the elaborate divine powers  the temple of Eridu built with silver for all this  Father Enki be praised

Cities do not boast men boast  At its base a snake that was immune to incantations made a nest  In its branches the Anzu bird placed its chick 
The demon maiden of the empty wind made a house in its middle  A laughing rejoicing young woman  I am Inanna who is now weeping 
His sister the one who spoke a word to him  The little ones were hammerstoneshandsized stones  The large ones were stones that made the reeds shake 
The keel of the little boat of Enki  They are sparrows witches that lay witchcraft like eggs  For the young woman they bind the hands of the young woman 
For the male they tie up the arms  They perform magic against the man  One of them brought  onto the food and the man eats it 
One of them brought murmuring into a beverage and the man drank it  IYou raise water to Utu of heaven  Water of the Tigris whose intake is open 
One of them passed a word through the water  emu flour set apart for the ghost  Wheat flour set apart for the gods

After you cleanse him with the oil of the incantation priest  After you purify and cleanse that man  After you clean him like a bowl used for ghee 
After you scrub him like a flask  After you pass his hand towards Utu the foremost of the gods  Like a bronze cup may he return him to the hand of his god

Towards heaven the altirigu bird is the bird of a god  Towards the earth it is the hoe in the reedbed it is a dog in the thicket it is an uumgal creature  At the site of battle it is a durallu ax 
When  gifted that of the netherworld on behalf of ErekigalWhen that of the netherworld was gifted on behalf of Erekigal  When he rode when he rode  When the father rode towards the netherworld

If a man is without a personal god  You will neither be increased nor diminished  During the descent into the river a fish will not pass by 
During the descent into the field a gazelle will not pass by  Great judgements will not occur regularly  Even if he runs ie hurries it will not occur readily 
If his god says Yes  Anything that is named is given approval  May you be our brother may you be our brother

If we do not write our various textstext sections ten times  It will indeed also be that when the master finds out we will be on guard with you 
What should we reply to him with there  Come I shall write what I please I will give you orders  If he has ordered me he has to admit I am not your big brother 
What if I enter into my status as big brother  After I surpass over the scribal art and an appropriate for status as big brother  I will say to you  possessor of cumbersome intelligence backwards facing towards ie inferior one of the scribal school 
Possessor of a  hand a hand that is not suitable for the stylus  One who is not suitable for claytablet with a hand that does not align with the mouth ie dictated content or rate of speech  You are really a scribe like me 
Why are you not a scribe like me  And why do you not say thus  Converse I am suitable for conversation 
I did not gnaw at sourdough I enter as the one standing  Looking two 5 times at a text and being one of reciting 5 textstext sections you say I am a scribe  You write a tablet and then you cannot bring its contents into the intellect 
Go to divide up an estate You cannot divide it  Go to fill ie map out a field You cannot hold the measuring line and rod  You cannot drive a stake into the ground you cannot bring it into your intellect ie comprehend it 
You do not calm down arguing people  You will make brother seize brother  Unsuitable idiot among scribes 
What are you suitable for Where should someone bring employ you  Why am I not suitable for anything  If I go to divide up an estate I can divide it 
If you count uprecite a multiplication table the calculation is labored  If you solve the inverted numbers you cannot return them to one side invert them again 
Volume calculations length to front eating each other calculation of the volume of a triangle  Squares triangles circles semicircles  Trapezoids field of a bow field of a boat 
If someone posits them to you you cannot produce them you are blocked in your mouth  You do not know the solutions of textstext sections and the contents of Sumerian tablets  After approach a stela shining light darkens for you 
And you are among the students of the scribal school  Why am I not among the students of the scribal school 
My tablet of the scribal art supplants your tablet of the scribal art   your humanity has been set with my humanity  I want to roll upwipe clean  I want to speak to you 
Among the work of the scribal art you are not above me in your   Among the work of the son of a man as a son of a man you are not above me  I want to say I want to repeat you are not the son of an established man 
The claytablet is good  my hand compares with the mouth in dictation speed content  When I bring my hand somewhere I bring  there for myself  The design the measuring rod the waterclock and its weight 
Hanging from it fully equipped tools that are not to be checked I shall find with my finger   on behalf of a friendcompanion  In order to bring on behalf of their laborwage the merchants silver for buying wool a total of four gin stone weights worth 
To initiate and concludeto raise and set the warp and weft the daily labor of the servile female weaver  The completed task of the metalworker the member of the experts I also have known its particulars  My engenderer is Sumerian I am the son of a scribe 
You cannot form a tablet you cannot pat out a ligin extract tablet  You cannot write your own name the tablet is not suited to your hand  Get up to do hoeing work so that the ub hoe is with you 
Childish fool cover your ears cover your ears Are you Sumeran like me  Why do you recite cover your ears cover your ears for me

Her holy knees are not covered with a garment  Her holy chest is not spread over with linen 
Enkidu did not accept the words of his master  He wore his cleanest garment  And therefore they marked him as a stranger 
He anointed himself with sweet oil from a stone vessel  They flocked around him because of its scent  He struck the netherworld with a bowthrowstick 
Ghosts gathered up around him  His put sandals on his feet 
He spoke aloud in the netherworld  He kissed his beloved spouse  He pelted the spouse he detested 
Did you see the man who had one child How has he fared  A nail is fixed in his wall he makes a bitter cry  Did you see the man who had two children How has he fared 
Upon two bricks he is sitting he is eating food  Did you see the man who had three children How has he fared  He is to drink water from the waterskin of the saddle peg 
Did you see the man who had 4 children How has he fared  Like a man who yokes 4 donkeys his heart is pleasedrejoicing  Did you see the man who had five children How has he fared

The man who is without a god if strong loss does not necessarily befall him  The man who is without a god if strong loss does not necessarily befall him 
One has rejected the other cursed the other insulted the other  You put an outcry in the scribal school 
By the possessor of a truthful heart he been taught Sumerian  The one who he  away from the assignment it was said  The sheaf that was not threshed his  which did not fall off 
You should be beaten on account of the output of this daily assignment   The outcry has not been a regular occurrence  Why the one who is your big brother 
Why did you speak with empty praise  You have offended him you have cursed him you have insulted him  The master did everything 
And grew exceedingly angry saying do as you wish  If you do as you wish  Because of the fact that the one who acted like you offended his big brother 
After being struck with the tablet shaping board as a weapon sixty times  After chains were placed on his feet  He was confined in the house and did not leave the scribal school for two months 
Now the sin has been released for you  From this day onwards their faces have been incised  Do not behave insultingly to each other 
Do not speak out brother with against brother do not initiate legal proceedings against each other  As for the quarrel of both Giriniisag and Enkimanum  The master arrives at a verdict for them 
Nisaba praise   did not seize him the netherworld seized him   did not seize him the netherworld seized him 
The site of manhood did not fell him in battle the netherworld seized him  The udug demon begotten by Nergal did not seize him the netherworld seized him  Father Enlil did not stand with him in this matter so he set out alone to Eridu 
 cast my ball into the netherworld   cast my mallet into the netherworld 
Now after you open a hole in the netherworld  Bring up his servant from the netherworld  The hero youth Utu the son given birth to be Ningal 
He opened up a hole in the netherworld  By means of his breeze Utus son a dream god he brought it an aspect of Enkidu out from the netherworld  He repeatedly hugged him and kissed him 
He was exhausting him with inquiries  Would that you will speak to me would that you will speak to me  You are someone that has seen the orders of the netherworld 
And I   The intellect of a man is the domain of his god 
You should not kiss your beloved son  You should not pelt your hated son  The complaint of the netherworld would seize you 
For the recumbent one for the recumbent one  For hero Ninazu the recumbent one  Where will  be brought to how will  succeed  
Where will  be brought to how will  succeed   Because of my uttered words  does not  weeping 
If I tell you about the regulations of the netherworld  You must sit and weep and I shall sit and weep  The penis that  has planted by which you have pleased your libido 
Like the wood of a dilapidated house it is infested by parasites  Having said where is the vagina I shall go to her  That vagina is filled with dust like a crevice 
As for you when you possess things they cover you as a garment  But when you do not possess things you wear no garment at all 
Whatever is yours you attach it to yourself  The pointed man and the existing man are praised   You yourself are praised 
But if you yourself are praised  You are not suitable for praising  You are not suitable for praising 
Lost one who is not found  If I have boasted  I am not suitable for boasting 
I am not suitable for boasting  How long must I be quarreling with you in these subjects  Now I cut you like a rope I hang you from my arm 
Peddlar shepherd of his own sustenance  Gir fish of the sea who thins its head out by itselfdenigrates itself  Liar rider of a distant country 
I will cut you from above like a rope  Poor person thief transgressor of the oath  Who joyfully serves among the slaves 
Hireling taboo of the temple  And you are my opponent  Shouter croaker among the singers 
Shouter croaker among the singers  Eating a great deal with the sustenance having a destructive effect  Possessor of a confused intellect with malevolent counsel 
You advise  The people are diminished because of you the people are diminished because of you  Roamer who prowls in the street 
Casing out the houses of men until you know the ways of that house in order to rob it  Weakling child reared in toil  As if you can posit the word of an opponent 
The god of that man the shepherd of that man  The god has not abandoned him  May the shepherd not  
The god has set down food and drinking water for the people  The god has set down food and drinking water for the people  You do not speak a conciliatory word 
You do not speak a conciliatory word  Like a person whose head is half shaved you have had no dignity  You have not deliberated you have not advised yourself 
You did not diminish the word in you heart  As if insulted you have not said do not speak  In your place where denigration is returned the password pun is not available to you 
Your slander is to be undertaken  And yet you are dwelling in the place of learning which your heart does not understand  Your colleagues do not attack against you and therefore you were confident 
You did not confront yourself  Insulting hurtful to another person hated by his colleagues  Evildoer carrying net of the enemy 
Possessor of an evil mouthwords possessor of a smiting face one of incorrect language  Wordchanger eyeturner one who carries things  I however confronted myself 
In the estate of my father according to my utterance  It is indeed the case that he has made a surplus he did not diminish its value and I can prove it to you  After you yourself were not present for the account 
As for my insults after my colleagues have said I want to say them too  I want to put an end to your insults at the outset  Possessor of two insides and two outsides duplicitous hypocritical eye turner 
One of injustice with the mouth of a slanderer  Idiot who converses falsely  What is it that you will putting an end to 
You father gladly served at the house of the merchant  Your brothers steal pigs they do not dwell in the city  Your sisters are grain roasters 
Who bring out roasted grain of the market rate from the cast downabandoned gigur containers  My insults against you are indeed the equal of that which you insulted me with  My insults are nothing they are shameless 
My words are nothing they should not trouble the heart  My mother is a matriarch of a well established household  Before her  serve

So that it ruins the plans according to the command of An and Enlil  It was the time when An frowned upon the lands  It was the time that Enlil set his gaze on another place 
It was the time that Nintur rejected her creations  It was the time that Enki changed the course of the Tigris and Euphrates  In order to destroy the me of Sumer in order to alter its plans 
In order to obfuscate the me and the reign of kingship in Ur  In order to defile the princely son in his Ekinugal temple  In order to tear apart the mesh of the people teemingpastured like ewes of Nanna 
So that its people do no dwell in their dwelling so that they are given into enemy territory  So that imagi and Elam the destructive people dwell in their dwellings  So that the enemy seizes their shepherd in his very own palace 
So that IbbiSn is brought to the land of Elam in a gebur traprestraint  From the sand dunes of Zabu on the shore of the sea to the border of Anan  Like a swallow that has flown from its house  nest he is not to return to his city 
In order to break up the founded city and outlying settlements into ruin mounds  In order to smite the teeming blackheaded people with the ha weapon  So that the hoe does not penetrate the fertile field so that the seed is not planted

So that the ilulama song the churning of the churn is not sung in the sheepfold  In order to diminish the herd in order to finish the wild animals  So that the dungbedding of the quadrupeds of Sumuqan does not touch the ground 
So that the evilheaded reed grows in the wetlands so that the wetlands die with a stench  So that the irrigated orchard with no new growth covers itself over  Urim the great wild bull standing wildly noble in and of itself

After I fill my heart and it overflows therefore I scorn you  On your own behalf you have not ceased your wailing  But I have set aside your wailing 
Because of the contentintent of what you are to speak  And the fact that I go forth from according to my word  In order to go away from according to my words here 
I am going away from here according to my words  Because you have not observed your humanity reflected upon yourself  My heart is carried away by an evil wind 
You make my heart go in the plain  Because of what I am I did not send you as one charged with the task to carry reeds from the reed bed 
The  olddead reeds which even the tiny children carry  Because of what you are you have not carried them  In no wayat no time have I said Stand at the rear of an ox 
I did not send you as one charged with the task to follow the ox  I did not send you as one charged with the task to hoe the field  I did not send you as one charged with the task to sowcultivate the field 
Because of who you are I have not spoken to you about this  Because of who you are you have not done the task but you did eat the food 
When a person like you does a task  His father and mother will eat food  If you observe the  of my colleagues 
Like ie each one of them ten gur of barley apiece they fill at the outsetper head  Even the tiny ones the slave of their fathers  Ten gur of barley apiece they place at the head ie provide 
You are not a man like each one of them  Exceeding you they do not compare with you in the performance of assigned tasks 
It was the frown of Enlil  After it killed Kish like the bull of heaven  After it slew the temple of Uruk in the dust like a great bull 
Where at that time to Sargon the king of Agade  From the lowland to the highland  After Enlil gave the enship and kingship to him 
May distress fall upon your palace which was built for rejoicing  May the evildoer shout continually in the  plain 
In the site of your uzga where the cleansing rite had been established  May the fox the one of the destroyed ruin mound drag its tail there   had grown thickened his neck a time that was not appointed  
 had grown thickened his neck a time that was not appointed   The one white in the skin like a boxwood tree a time that was not appointed   A form as if cast from a mold the statue the beautiful thing  
The one who is speckledfaced like a bison a time that was not appointed   My beardedness that of my beautiful formstatue a time that was not appointed    did not act like a juvenile did not sin  
Enlil made starvation in the form of an evil person dwell in the city  He made that which destroys cities that which destroys temples dwell in the city  He made that which before it a weapon does not stand against dwell in the city 
He made the hungrydissatisfied and the eyeroller dwell in the city  In Ur even the feardisdain of head shaking like a single planted reed was not established  Its people took refuge like a fish living in a wellpond 
Meager and great alike spread out no one arosewas mustered  The king mounted atop the gate tower there was no food there for him  The king who had ate and drank good things had to now clutch at a mere ration 
He did not have beer in his brewery its  was not present  There was no food for him in his palace it was not suitable for dwelling  His supreme storehouse was not filled with grain no one could take refuge there 
The grain goddess was not present in the large and small grain heaps  The afternoon meal of the gods was actively diminished there  In the great banquet the honeyed liquor ceased 
As for the giriPAa knife that consumes oxen and sheep it lay abandoned in the plants  In the great oven the oxen and sheep were not being prepared ie roasted one could no longer smell it  The crybreath of the purearmed bursag buildingfunctionary stopped 
The deposit of the properly executed deliveries was a distant memory  The millstone the mortar and the pestle sat idle no one bends down towards them  In the lapis harbor of Nanna boats were bound in the water due to silt 
The water of the prow did not scream it did not cast joy  Sand was piled up in the unuRIbanda buildingshrine of Nanna  The  rushes grew the  rushes grew the reed of mourning grew 
Boats and barges quit the shining harbor  In your canal that was made suitable for barges no one was rowing anymore  The plans of the festival at the place of rites was changed 
 could not bring its nindaba offerings to Nibru for him  There was emptiness in the rivercanal barges were not traversing it  No foot was setpresent on its two banks tall plants grew 
The reed fence of the orchard was   established a breach  The cow was seized along with its calf  The munzer fed cows took to a strange path in an unknown part of the plain 
Gayau who loves cows dropped his weapon in the beddingdung  unidug the one who stores butter and cheese did not store butter and cheese  People who did not know butter were churning its butter 
People who did not know milk were  its milk  In the cattle pen the churning churn was not bellowing nobly  The heavy coals that had been lit their smoke ceased 
My birth father my city was  for youhim why did you turn away from me  Enlil my Ur was  for youhim why did you turn away from me  The nesag offering ships of his birth father no longer brought the nesag offering for him 
 could not bring its nindaba offerings to Enlil at Nibru for him  The winds carried off the en priestess of the outer city and the en priestess of the inner city  Ur like a city struck by a hoe has been broken up into ruin heaps 
The Kiur shrine the place of relaxation of Enlil has been made into a windblown shrine  Enlil  your eye at your city it is an empty wasteland  The dogs of Ur are not sniffing at the base of the city wall 
My birth father turn around my city back to your arms from its loneliness  Enlil turn around my Ur back to your arms from its loneliness  Turn around my Ekinugal temple back to your arms from its loneliness 
So that my Ur is brought out so that the people are broadened  So that he returns the me of Sumer which were destroyed to their place  It is the 3rd kirugu 
Alas the true temple the true temple its man its man  It is the gegigal response  Enlil was replying to his son Suen 
The dog gave nothing to the ferryboat but strikes the ferryboat with his paw  The dog gave nothing to the ferryboat but strikes the ferryboat with his paw  The dog gave nothing to the ferryboat but strikes the ferryboat with his paw 
The dog gave nothing to the ferryboat but strikes the ferryboat with his paw  When you are to cross the street do not look around If you are humble  And you fear your overseer 
Your overseer will love you  If the objective is to be achieved when you speak to your companion  Do not turn behind for him 
Do not denigrate your colleagues  If you are going because the day is about to arrive  How long shall I stay 
I knowuntil my master has left  Because of what I am I did not send you as one charged with the task to carry reeds from the reed bed 
The olddead reeds which even the tiny and little children carry  Because of what you are you have not carried them  In no wayat no time have I said Stand at the rear of an ox 
Regarding my ox I did not send you as one charged with the task to follow it  Regarding my field I did not send you as one charged with the task to hoe it  Regarding my field I did not send you as one charged with the task to sowcultivate it 
I did not send you as a messenger charged with a task to do a task or to hoe  Come After you do the work eat food  Because of who I am I have not spoken to you about this 
Because of who you are you have not done the task but you did eat the food  When a person like you does a task  His father and mother will eat food 
If you observe the  of my colleagues  Like ie each one of them ten gur of barley apiece  They place at the head ie provide 
As a man I exceed you  You are not a man like each one of them 
My son their fathers  Dispatched their childrenjuniors charged with a task  My inferior like them 
They do not compare with you in the performance of assigned tasks  Excessive is my exertion for you  Who is it that has exerted himself for his son more that I 
It has not previously been the case Have fear It has not previously been the case Have shame  Your companion with whom you are standing in the same yoke   your comrade your friend you do not observe them 
Why do you not assimilate with them  It has not previously been the case Now assimilate with your big brothers  It has not previously been the case Now assimilate with your little brothers  From the ranks of skilled humanity that resides in the land 
Come Enki himself has discovered that nothing that has a name among them  Is as painstaking as the assigned task of the place of scribal art  Nothing that could be named except for the art of the musician 
You can be idle for eternity  Greatly your that which is released has been enlarged  Because your  reputation has not been smitten 
Because your reputation has not been beaten into the dust  Because of what has been destroyed I will recite to you the following for my benefit  What now to do 
What now to do  That which I did was not  
Its stolen rushes  carried away the rushes   Its stolen rushes  carried away the rushes  
Its stolen rushes  carried away the rushes    piled up and spread  out  in the manner of sheaves   a corpse was in the Euphrates  
 turned away from  and was not saying my spouse   turned away from  and was not saying my son  The one of the true templeproductive estate abandoned his temple and was not saying my temple 
The rich person took a different path away from his possessions   the hero  
 took a different path away from his beloved   The one that is saying  my city  Kazallu the city that teemed by itself was confused 
Numuda took a different path away from his city his beloved dwelling  His wife Namrat the beautiful woman was weeping bitterly  Emptiness was in the river  could not irrigate 
Like a river cursed by Enki its intake was blocked   did not have grain in the field the people did not eat  The watered orchards were baked like an oven the plain was dispersed 
 The city that Enlil did not inquire  after  The city that An frowned at  The city that Nudimmud who was angry at 
The city that  fashioned a bitter fate  for  The city in which the slave raises weapons against  The city that the enemy did not quit the weapon against 
The city that  will say its young woman does not rejoice  The city that  will say its young man does not rejoice  The city whose trees and reeds are sick 
The city that  destroyed in battle  The city that the slave beat the chest against in battle ie revolted  The city that the spouse abandoned that the son abandoned 
The city that young woman abandoned the young man abandoned  The deity of the temple  was not suitable for hisher temple anymore  Heshe did not retain hisher possessions 
Its  did not wear a garment  Its  did not eat bread  Its dogs laid down among the corpses instead of devouring them 
The  birds were eating the corpses  The men of the front died at the bow  The men of the rear died at the stern 
In the middle of the city  destroyed the middle of the city  In the outside of the city  destroyed the outside of the city  In the harbor of my city  killed  
 bent over ie died   bent over ie died 
A  of clay will not be able to cross the river himself  A  of clay will not be able to cross the river himself  A  of clay will not be able to cross the river himself 
Enlil was replying to his son Suen  In the  of of the windswept city the reed of mourning grows in lamentation  In the  the reed of mourning grows in lamentation 
In the  he spends time in lamentation  My son if you yourself are a native son then it is you who is the one whose tears they are  Nanna if you yourself are a native son then it is you who is the one whose tears they are 
There is no revocation of a final verdict the word of the assembly  The uttered word of An and Enlil knows no change  If Ur was given kingship  did not give an eternal term of office 
Who has seen a reign of kingship taking precedence forever  In order to lengthen the term of kingship in order to take counsel to that effect  My Nanna do not become exhausted doing this leave your city 
At that time my king the native son quitkilled his liverlungs  Lord Dilimbabbar fashioned a destroyedevil heart  Nanna who loved his city left his city 
Ningal in order to go as a stranger of her city to a strange place  Hurriedly she got dressedbraided a rope for escape and left the city  The Anuna of Ur stood outside 
In Ur its trees were sick its reeds were sick  A lament was competing with the wall up to its circuit in terms of completeness  Daily weapons were smashing heads before it 
In Ur great hazin axes were sharpened before it  They were setting the spears the arms of battle in order  Great bows throw sticks and shields were consuming together 
Barbed arrows filled its outside like a rainstorm  Great stones made a thudding pudpad noise by themselves  Daily an evil wind returns among the city 
In Ur the noble one divested of his strength stood among the murderers  The enemy defeated the people those who stood among the weapons  In the city the ones who did not advance against the weapons dwelledsat in hunger 
Starvation thus filled the city it was not ceasing  In hunger they were bowing their heads and twisting their muscles  Its people filled the ponds they were  
Its king breathed painfully in his own house  Its humanity dropped their hands their weapons touched the ground  They gatheredclasped their hands to their necks they were weeping 
Alas what is it that we will say what is it that we will add  How long until we are to be finished in the mouth of catastrophe  The inside of Ur is death the outside is death 
How long until we are to be finished within that of starvation inside the city  How long until we are to be finished among the weapons of Elam outside the city  The enemy stands in Ur we must come to an end 
Acting on behalf of their life and their back they spoke together  They opened the bolt of the gate the storm was making its door stand in the street  Elam set foot there like a great onrushing flood 
They could not sprint away as fugitives they were seized within the walls limits  Like fish living in a pond they were seeking refuge  The enemy dwelled in the Ekinugal temple of Nanna 
They were breaking the holy having heavy possessions bird  They cut down the statue that occupied the uzga shrine  Nineigara the supreme steward abandoned the storehouse 
Its throne was covered over from the front she could only sit in the dust instead  They seized the great cows atby their  horns  cut their horns off   smote goring bulls with the weapon like they were grazing sheep 
The date palm of like strong copper the arm of heroism  It was torn out like a rush it was cut like a rush it was turned sideways in its roots  Its top was lodged in the ground a person to raise it was not available 
 trimmed its midribs and set its top on fire   its spadix with ripe dates  the well  The gizi reed that grew in the holy  were actively diminished 
As for your colleagues their fathers do not dispatch their childrenjuniors charged with a task   I like them do not dispatch someone with a task like them  Excessive is my exertion for you 
Who is it that has exerted himself for his son more that I  Among my colleagues that which is observeddisapproved of has been presentopen  But that which I observeddisapproved of has not been present 
My words which I recite to you are as follows it has not previously been the case Have fear It has not previously been the case Have pride  Your companion with whom you both are standing in the same yoke  Because you do not observe him that is why you cannot assimilate with him 
It has not previously been the case Now assimilate with your big brothers  It has not previously been the case Now assimilate with your little brothers  From the ranks of skilled humanity that resides in the land 
Enki named among everything that has been named the assigned task of the scribal art as the most painstaking  Enki named among everything that has been named the assigned task of the scribal art as the most painstaking  Why  the scribal art  
Come may you find its name  Nothing named that could be named except for the art of the musician  Like the shores of the sea where one shore is separated far away from the other 
You do not say I want to pay attention to the pointed remarks of my father  The fate of man decreed by Enlil  
In no wayat no time has the formula lesson been listened to by you  As one who speaks of the meager things he created 
Saying One should not pain themselves by fixing the eyes ie studying intently  Saying I sought the place of my father  Because of you I cannot sleep well either at night or at the midday 
My sternum separates for you  I spend the night time   Like a bare backed vessel I drip for you 
You are thick  You are nervous from excitement you are growingboasting you are thin you are   My colleagues stand towards you as evildoers 
Because you do not observe your fellow man you think that they delight over you  You succeed atexecute your play  If your are at the site of a derision contest 
The one who behaves like you is jumping around before them  You assigned task now is jumping around  This is your befitting role 
After I shall to speak to you about it  Let go that which you are able to assimilate withyou are to do to assimilate with me  Its throne was covered over from the front she could only sit in the dust instead 
They seized the great cows atby their  horns  cut their horns off   smote goring bulls with the weapon like they were grazing sheep  The date palm of like strong copper the arm of heroism 
 tore it out like a rush it was cut like a rush it was turned sideways in its roots  Its top was lodged in the ground it did not have a person to raise it   trimmed its midribs and set its top on fire 
The gizi reeds that grew in the holy  and the trees were bowed to the ground  The great tribute that  deposited there was carried away into the mountain  In the temple its gebur ormanment fell its parapet was destroyed 
Its  embracing on its right and left  Like smitten heroes they were covered from the front  Its great stormdemon with an open mouth and the face of an awebearing pirig creature 
The enemy territory brought away the one felled with a saman rope like a caught wild bull  The scent of the dwelling of holy Nanna which was like a juniper forest was brought to an end  And the awe of the temple which had been goodthe awe was now destroyed 
The one that filled the lands like sunlight was rebuilt like the evening in heaven instead   farmer of the gods   farmer of the gods

Kusu the chief sanga priest of Enlil  Took the great standard 
He purifies it he sanctifies it  It is the incantation of the great standard  Water that flowed from the pure mountain water that flowed from the pure mountain range 
Halhal the mother of the mountain range  Gave birth to it in the midst of the mountain  The pure place the holy place coming out from the mountain range

People who did not know cream were  its cream  In the cattle pen the churning churn was not bellowing nobly  The heavy coals that had been lit their smoke ceased 
 the great dining hall of Nanna   Suen wept to his father Enlil  My birth father my city was  for him why did you turn away from me 
Enlil my Ur was  for him why did you turn away from me  My Ekinugal temple was  for him why did you turn away from me  The nesag offering ships of my birth father no longer brought the nesag offering for him 
 could not bring its nindaba offerings to Enlil ofat Nibru for him  The winds carried off the en priestess of the outer city and the en priestess of the inner city  Ur like a city struck by a pickax has been broken up into ruin heaps 
The Kiur shrine the place of relaxation of Enlil has been made into a windblown shrine  Greatly your that which is released has been enlarged  Because your  reputation has not been smitten 
Because your reputation has not been made to touch the dust  Because of what has been destroyed I will recite to you the following  What now to do 
If I have loved you  You have not learned from the deeds which I have done  Afflicted person wind man idiot possessing  hands and feet  sorcery 
Wind man idiot thief who breaks into houses  Insulting person who smells  Barbarian ecstatic 
Possessing lips spewing scraps that make things painful  Head dragger cripple  Possessing a scent that induces vomiting an evil stench 
One who makes other people say I want to hide stinking  possessor of a stinking anus  Dog with its head pressed to the ground who is sniffing  Dog with its head pressed to the ground who is sniffing 
A soldier who acting like you prowls the streets because of his sustenance  Possessing a head that is not good for its mouth an evil head  Dog that licks its penis with its tongue 
Donkey that eats its own bedding  Wearer of only a loincloth laying down on the oven  One who drops thingsfalls into a well dropped by the demon lugaluraBlrim ie an attack of epilepsy 
 ecstatic who eats stinking things   wallfigure stretching out  behind someone  Loose hair that is deposited along with the foundation in the house 
One whose head is half shaved by   Inappropriate person  denouncerinformer  Cripple possessing thighs but also blunted hipsbuttocks a blunted nose altogether a physiognomy that is not fitting for a man 
Until one and as whom will you go like this The one who insults you  May the one who insults you be 36 doubleleagues away from your person  May your curser be 36 doubleleagues away from your person 
So that your fellow man raises your neck and chest  And you will be reckoned among the learned people of your city  And your city the good place invokes your name 
And your god names you with a good name a true word  Be pleasing in the eye of Nanna your god  Longtablet of Damqiiliu month of NENEgar 7th day 
Enki king of   Asalluhi citizen of Eridu   Your  your mouth your foot  
May  be holy like heaven may  be pure like earth  Like the midst of heaven may  be clean  Incantation of the waters edge 
The junior scribe for whom the edge of the rushes is  is a bad thing  rushes for his bedding  are not pulled out 
The gizi reeds that grew in the holy enclosure were actively diminished  The enemy carried away the great tribute that  deposited there  In the temple its gebur ormanment fell its parapet was destroyed 
 embracing on its right and left  Like smitten heroes they were covered from the front  Its great stormdemon with an open mouth and the face of an awebearing pirig creature 
 were felling them with a saman rope like a caught wild bull enemy territory    brought the scent of the dwelling of holy Nanna which was like a juniper forest to an end  Its asalbar feature the one that was overlaid with gold and lapis  
The one that had filled the lands like sunlight was rebuilt like the evening of heaven instead  Its door the one that  sunlight like a beautifulverdant star of heavenconstellation  And the great boundary stakes shouted so that  would not tear them out 
Its hinge  was defiled with a stunned silence  Together with its door fitting it wept like a fugitive  The holy bolt and bar were no longer fixed oncontrolling the great door 
The noise of the previously fixedcontrolled door fell silent it had no one to fixcontrol it   was actively diminished it set  in the broad street  In the royal offering place the nindaba offering of the royal offering place was changed 
Among its supreme tigi drums the aua functionary did not sing pure songs  At the gate tower where fates are to be determined there were no affairs  The throne where cases had been decided no longer stood cases were not undertaken correctly 
NannaSuens vizier Alamu dropped the scepter with his hand shaking  In the holy bed chamber of Nanna  shall not  at his feet  The holy treasure box which no one is to see the enemy saw inside of it 
 did not set up the pure bedbed of flowers  did not spread out shining plants upon it  They were cutting down the statue that occupied the uzga shrine  The dream interpreter the engiz temple cook and the seal bearer did not use the eda vessel properly 
Suen brought his  there for his father  He knelt there before his birth father Enlil  My birth father how long will the eye of the enemy have looked at my  how long  
On my hair bound up with the suh headresspectoral  The great cleaned pure day has become dirty   Examine faithfully your heart darkened by anger which terrifies like a wave 
Enlil was speaking a true word to his son Suen  The destroyed city the flattening of the parapet of the great wall by the storm this too is a part of the turn of office  One who  for the dark days of you term of office may open the temple be spoken 
May  rebuild it  may the people bow down towards it  May  have bread  at its base may Anan dwell with it  May there be joy in its branches may Utu rejoice with him 
On its   may the abundance of Anan embrace   May Ur the city decreed by An be returned to its place for you  May Enlil like a true speaker raise his neck towards heaven 
For Nanna may the high and low land assemble  For Suen may he set the roads of the land of land in order  With a noise like a rainstorm touching the earth may pounding stones be employed for him 
Father Nanna stood in his city Ur with head held high  The youth Suen was able to enter into his Ekinugal temple  Ningal was relaxing in her pure chamber 
He was able to enter into Ur into his Ekinugal temple  It is the 4th kirugu  The city was an empty wind in its midst the reed of lamentation grew in lament 
In its midst the reed of lamentation grew in lament  Its people spend the day in lamentation  It is its gegigal response 
Month Harvest 18th day  Who changed its discernment who altered its intelligence  Who struck its good udug protective spirit Who beat its lamma protective spirit 
Who ruined the aura and radiance that had been on its head  Who  the dignity of Uruk who  the nugig midwife  Along with the city the foreign lands  in Uruk who  in its temple

The elite of the troops who emerged separate from the average man   Gutium  the weapon   Not even looking with both of their eyes  
A pig takes away  as if for itself  and its master both 
The men of the front died at the bow of the boat  The men of the rear died at the stern  In the middle of the city  destroyed the middle of the city

 my master in order to writefoster instruction   put water in the field the city was consumed by the marsh ie destroyed   was being done like the reeds of a wasteland giving birth was not being established 
A stupor covered the terrified heart of the people like a garment  Its good udug protective deity left its lamma protective deity fled  The lamma protective deity roamed in the plain it took a different path 
On behalf of your I want to work  a bed  I want to bake I want to bake  the owner of the oven has entered  I want to bake I want to bake  the owner of the oven has entered

In the holy bed chamber of Nanna  he does not  aton his feet  The holy treasure box which no one is to see the enemy saw inside of it   did not set up the pure bedbed of flowers  did not spread out shining plants upon it 
They were cutting down the statue that occupied the uzga shrine  The engiz temple cook dream interpreter and seal bearer did not use the eda vessel properly  They stood in the manner of one whose neck is pushed to the ground the mountaindwellers carried them away 
In the holy uzga shrine the agadala priests of the pure washing rites  They were forsaking the pure plans and the me they went to another city  Suen brought his ruined heart there for his father 
He knelt there before his birth father Enlil  My birth father how long will the eye of the enemy have looked at the accounts how long   When you give lordship and kingship do not  towards meon my behalf 
Father Enlil the one of the true order and command  Father Enlil it is the fate that you decreed and therefore no one can release its logic  On my hair bound up with the suh headresspectoral 
The destroyed city the flattening of the parapet of the great wall by the storm this too is a part of the turn of office  One who  for the dark days of you term of office may open the temple be known  Previous dweller in your dwelling the Etemenniguru temple which was built faithfully 
May  rebuild it in joy may the people bow down towards it  May  have bread  at its base may Anan rejoice with him  May  have joy in its branches may Utu rejoice 
On its table may the abundance of Anan embrace   May Ur the city decreed by An be returned to its place for you  May Enlil who is the true speaker raise his neck towards heaven 
For Nanna may the high and low land assemble  For Suen may he set the roads of the land of land in order  Touching the ground like a rainstorm  
It was the spoken word of An and Enlil and therefore it was being carried out faithfully  Nanna stood in his city Ur with head held high  Suen was able to enter the Ekinugal temple 
Ningal was relaxing in her pure chamber  The youth Suen was able to enter into his Ekinugal temple  Bitter storm storm raise you chest depart storm turn backconfine yourself in your house 
Storm destroyer of cities storm raise you chest depart storm turn backconfine yourself in your house  Storm destroyer of temples storm raise you chest depart storm turn backconfine yourself in your house  May the storm that once spent time in Sumer spend time in the other lands instead 
May the storm that once spent time in the land spend time in the other lands instead  May it spend time in the land of Tidnum instead may it spend time in that land  May it spend time in the land of Gutium instead may it spend time in that land 
So that in Ur the term of office and abundance last long  So that the people lay down in the meadows and copulate  Alas humanity is stricken and gathered up

From his instruction only the foolish novice passes by freelyforgetfully  Fear that is to scare the writing hand wearing it on my figuretrunk and limbs in order to stand before him in the place of prostration  In order to ameliorate the rage to attend to the anger 
I did the assignment correctly for you  When I go in the street with neck bowed to the ground  And my head not to be raised no one scorned me 
Laughing does not   Humbly  enters the house of my father   is before my father mother older brother older sister and female servant 
I am Shulgi after I was born I was a mighty male  I am a pirig creature with a furious face that was given birth to by an uumgal creature 
I am the king of the four quarters  I am the herder and shepherd of the blackheaded  I am the authoritative one the god of the lands

My idle days are three days per month  The various festivals are three days per month  In the midst of what remains in the month there are 24 days 
My dwelling in the school is not measured with deductible days  In each single day my master requires that I produce my nigsuru assignment 4 times  The account having been established my knowledge of the scribal art is not taken away 
Now I can apply myself to the contents of tablets to multiplication tables and calculations  The scribal art putting entries in their context without nigsuru assignments   My master speaking pleasantly his prayer on my behalf 
I know my scribal art  I do not restrict  concerning anything  My master selects one sign

The lady after that of the voice the balag drumlyre of lamentation was being founded  She herself was minimally ie softly intoning an ilu lamentintoning little ilu laments of the silenced   The storm that is set for me its sorrowwailing hangs upon me 
I am the woman whom the storm is set for  The storm that is set for me its sorrowwailing exhausts me  The storm the bitter storm is set for me 
And therefore I wail because of that storm  Because of the powerwing of the storm I cannot bring out   And therefore even for a short length of days in my reign propitious days in my reign propitious days  has not seen 
And therefore I wail because of that night  Because of the powerwing of the night I cannot bring out   The storm that is about to destroy like a flood hangs for me by itselfin its aura 
Because of this in my bed chamber of the night  Calm sleep is not put in my bedchamber of the night  Because of this the silencing of the bedchamber

My temple which was established by the just man  Therefore the storm has beaten it at its outside  In my Ekinugal the temple of kingship 
My true temple that initiates lamentation there along with her ie me  After being built falsely and destroyed truthfully  must not establish as its allocated share for me  Therefore like a tent a building torn out at the harvest site like a building torn out at the harvest site it was subjected to wind and rain 
Urim my grain storage filled with food  Therefore the empty wind howls in the silent city  Like the sheepfold of the shepherd it was torn out 
It is the 3rd kirugu refrain  Urim has initiated lamentation to her detriment  Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
It is the gegigal response  At that time this time after the city was flattened  To the detriment of the lady her city is destroyed 
Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment  At that time this time after the city was created  When they have ordered my city to be destroyed 
When they have ordered its people to be killed  At that time I will not be indifferent to my city  I will not neglect my land 
For An I shall pour the tears of my eyes  I shall supplicate myself to Enlil  I shall say to himthem My city must not be destroyed 
I shall say to himthem Urim must not be destroyed  I shall say to himthem Its people must not be killed  Despite this An did not rescind his word 
Therefore when they have ordered my city to be destroyed  When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed  When they have ordered its people to be killed 
For a 2nd time after they convened an assembly a solemn place  The Anuna rested on the organized ie finalized word  Therefore I shall extend my limbslap and tie up my hair 
For An I shall pour the tears of my eyes  I shall supplicate myself to Enlil  I shall say to himthem My city must not be destroyed 
I shall say to himthem Its people must not be killed  Despite this An did not rescind his word  Despite this the statement It is good so be it of Enlil was not soothing my heart 
Therefore when they have ordered my city to be destroyed  When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed  When they have ordered its people to be killed 
I as one who gave my advice to my detriment   therefore shall also bind me with my city   therefore shall also bind Urim with me 
That which issues from the mouth of Enlil is not to be changed  It is the 4th kirugu  To the detriment of the lady her city is destroyed 
Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment  It is the gegigal response  Enlil spoke to the storm and the people wailed 
He deprived the land of days of abundance and the people wailed  He deprived Sumer of good days and the people wailed  He commanded the malevolent storm and the people wailed 
He gave them to the kiggal official of the storm his attendant stormwho stood within the storm  He spoke to the storm annihilating the land and the people wailed  He spoke to the great storm the one of An and the people wailed 
Enlil was making Gibil fire into his helper  He spoke to the great storm of An and the people wailed  The great storm was shouting from above and the people wailed 
An evil wind overflowing like a great flood which does set down its powerwing  In the city the weapon was murdering and consuming as if in a pack  At the base of heaven the storm gnawed and the people wailed 
The storm was burning with fire at its front and the people wailed  And therefore the raging storm like a fireshade  at its back  Noon which usually raises the rainy wind fog was burning with fire instead 
Midday which usually brings out bright sunlight brought darkness along with it  The shining sun did not come out in the land it dissipated like the evening  The southern wind seized the joyful night which initiates the cooling of water 
The storm blew a wind upon the blackheaded people and the people wailed  Sumer was tripping as if in a gebur snare and the people wailed  The people were erecting a wall of heads the storm devouring as if in a pack 
The bitter storm for which weeping was not decreed as its fate because of this the people wailed  The eradicatinggathering storm was sweeping the landmaking the land tremble  The storm utterly destroyed the city like a flood 
The storm that was finishing the land established silence in the city  The storm burning like fire was enraged withcorporeally burned the peopleland  The storm that is to cause everything to be forgotten stood among the malevolent ones 
It covered Ur like a garment spread over it like linen  It is the 5th kirugu  The storm is a lion thrashing and the people wail 
It is the gegigal response  At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps  Father Nanna the city has been placed into ruins and the people wailed 
The storm deprived the land of  and the people wailed  The land was devastated until there was not even a broken sherd and the people wailed  The storm made a breach in the wall and the people wailed 
In the broad lane prepared as if for a festival heads were placed as seeds  In the streets where there were paths it was piling up corpses  In the playground where there was a festival it spread out people as sheaves 
Ditchesburial pits were put down for the blood of land like it would be done for the drainpipe of heaven  That of the corpses like sheep fat in sunlight dissolved by themselves  Like a man ended by a hazin axe one was not bothering to clothe his headwear a turban as a bandage 
Like a goat buck caught by a snare one lodged his mouth in the dirt  And therefore like a man ended by the mitum weapon one did not bother to wear bandages  As if lying in the birthing place of their mother one laid in his blood 
Those who served with weaponry were slaughtered by weaponry  The storm took away fugitive men and gazelles alike and the people wailed  In Urim the weak and strong alike came to an end out of hunger 
The elder women and men who did not leave the house were set on fire  Water brought away the tiny ones  from the lap of the mother like fish  The strong grasp of the wetnurse this grasp was loosened 
Allegiancesense was forgotten and the people wailed  The treasury of the land was eradicated and the people wailed 
Possessed of everything and anything of the cosmic powers  Girded with ancient designs  Girded with ancient designs

At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps  Father Nanna the city has been placed into ruins and the people wailed  The storm deprived the land of  and the people wailed 
The land was devastated until there was not even a broken sherd left and the people wailed  A breach was made in the wall and the people wailed  At the great gate where there was a path it was piling up corpses 
In the broad lane prepared as if for a festival heads were placed as seeds  In the streets where there were paths it was piling up corpses  In the playground where there was a festival it spread out people as sheaves 
That of the corpses like sheep fat in sunlight dissolved by themselves  Like a man ended by a hazin axe one was not bothering to clothe his headwearing a turban as a bandage  Like a goat buck caught by a snare one lodged his mouth in the dirt 
And therefore like a man ended by the mitum weapon one did not bother to wear bandages  As if lying in the birthing place of their mother one laid in his blood  Those who had not drunk wine nonetheless hung their necks down lit on the shoulder as if drunk 
Those who served with weaponry were slaughtered by weaponry  The storm took away fugitive men and gazelles alike and the people wailed  In Urim the weak and strong alike came to an end out of hunger 
Water brought away the tiny ones  the lap of the mother like fish  The strong grasp of the wetnurse this grasp was loosened  The allegiancesense of the land was forgotten and the people wailed 
The treasury of the land was forgotten and the people wailed  The mother left her city for to the detriment of her son and the people wailed  The father turned away from his son and the people wailed 
In the city the spouse was abandoned the child was abandoned possessions were scattered  The blackheaded people went into s solemn place  The lady left her city like a frightened bird 
And therefore the possessions  amassed there were annihilated  In the treasury which had possessed  plundered itself  Even in the ponds Gibil the purifier was performing work 
The high mountain range which no hand approaches oh lord of the Ekinugal temple  The true temple the great hazin axes were consuming as if in a pack  The troops of imagi and Elam the destructive ones were treating it as if it was worth thirty shekels 
Its lady was crying Alas my city she was crying Alas my temple  Ningal was crying Alas my city she was crying Alas my temple  The woman the storm destroyed her city the storm destroyed her temple 
Nanna shrine Urim is destroyed and the people are scattering  It is the 6th kirugu  In her cattlepen in her sheepfold the woman shouts bitterly the storm is destoying the city 
It is its gegigal response  Mother Ningal stands apart from her city like an enemy  The woman cries bitterly about the fate of her destroyed city 
An must curse my city my city must be destroyed  Enlil must curse my temple the pickaxe must strike  He must cast fire upon my  coming from the lowland my city must be destroyed 
Enlil must touch down lightning flame upon his highland  At the outskirts of the city the outer city must be destroyed and I shall say Alas my city  In the middle of the city the inner city must be destroyed and I shall say Alas my city 
My temple in the outskirts of the city is being destroyed and I shall say Alas my city  My temple in the middle of the city is being destroyed and I shall say Alas my city  Therefore the city is not pastured for me like a fertile ewe its true shepherd is not present 
My ox does not stand in the cattlepen its herder is not present  My sheep do not dwell in their sheepfold their herder is not present  The canal of the city thickens with silt and produces fox dens 
In its course it does not bring flowing water its canal inspector is not present  In the fields of my city grain is not present its farmer is not present  In my field like a field that the pickax has struck to destroy it and render it unusable only the star of the field plant grows 
In the irrigated orchards that heap up syrup and wine the thornbush of the mountain grows grows  In the steppe whose joy was surpassingfilled it it was emitting a baking scent like an oven  My possessions are taken away flying like a flock of crows taking flight I must cry My possessions 
My possessions coming from the highland are brought back to the highland I must cry My possessions  The storm scatters me away from my precious metal and lapis I must cry My possessions  My treasure is annihilated I must cry My possessions 
People who know nothing of precious metal fill the hand with my precious metal and consume it  People who know nothing of lapis load their necks with my lapis  It is the month of GurInanna the 14th day 
Its ruler is a ruler that makes divisions  Its ruler is a ruler that makes divisions  The great pirig creature of rulership 
Temple that bears an aura the luhu functionary of Eridu  The great ruler with hair adorned with an abundance of tiny    the great en priest 
 Enki  When he dwells there in the Eengur temple  When he builds the Abzu of Eridu 
When he takes counsel at the Halankug shrine  And the prince   And the prince  
The princely son  a siskur offering  The grain of the  of the Ekur a mash tub  
The grain of the  of the Ekur a mash tub   The grain of the  of the Ekur a mash tub  
May the  of the Ekur eat bread    no one    no one  
That of the Ekur  the word of my king   paid attention its groupsbundlesjoints   May the door of the Ekur  its neck   Its  the foremost of heaven may it  its backoutside 
The grain of the  of the Ekur a mash tub   May the  of the Ekur eat bread    no one

The junior Enlil of the lands he was the 3rd one  He sought the me of both heaven and earth and founded a dwellingsitting there  The water that engenders the true seed was bound to his hand 
The Tigris and Euphrates having been excavated on the edge brought water into the lands  He dredged the small canals the ditches were established there   Enki broadened the cattle pen and sheepfold he made them acquire a shepherd and cow herder 
He made the king acquire their shepherdship he raised him to their princeship  He brought out the king as faithful sunlight in the lands  Enki knotted the marshes together he made the old reed growth and fresh reed stalks grow 
He made fish and birds live in the great marshes the ponds and the supreme marshes  In the plain he gave the means of eating and drinking to living creatures  Enki the lord of abundance the lord of the gods stationed  at its side in charge 
Nudimmud the supreme prince the lord of broad wisdom  After he created both the fish and the bird  He filled the marsh and reedbed with them 
He made their eyes discover their design  At that time the fish laid eggs in the deep watermarsh  The bird founded a nest at the intake of the reed bed 
The bird terrified the fish in the deep watermarsh by means of its scream  The fish stood he was shouting to the bird  It was boasting by means of a fight he intiated a quarrel

At that time the fish insulted the bird  Because of its beauty the bird knew about its multicolored back and multicolored face  Whatever insults fish had assailed it with it did not ponder them 
It was as if a nursemaid was singing a lullaby  It was not heeding these words laughing malevolently instead  At that time the bird was replying to the fish

Possessor of trimmed limbs crippled feet a  mouthbeak and a thinned outflattened tongue  By means of ignorance you have been able to sneershoutchew but you have not advised yourself  I the fish am the one who piles up the abundance of the pure shrinesea together 
The harvest rejoices with me as if it was a festival my inquirer is there  Bird what is your great thing that you accomplished I will make you known your over exuberance 
I want to return back into your mind your arrogance and mendacious speech  At that time the fish was to make plans against the bird  Silently and deceptively it went on its arms 
When the bird got up from its nest in order to bring back food for its chick  The fish sought the place silently  It struck the birds established nest its prepared plants making it a windswept shrine 
It killed its eggs and its nest with water it covered them in the sea  For a 2nd time the fish insulted the bird  At that time the bird with the face of a pirig creature and the claws of a hurin bird 
It was beating its wings towards its nest but its flight path was blocked  With its mouth it was screaming in the midst of heaven like the nugig midwife of heaven ie Inanna  At that time the bird which was looking carefully its limbs were spread out 
Like a stormwind that is to shake to the midst of heaven it roamed in heaven  The bird was searching the fish in the deep water it sought it in the marshes  The bird saw the fish in the deep water and planned against it 
It heaped up its little spawn together it heaped them in the manner of sheaves  The bird took out revenge but its heart was not cooling  For a 2nd time the bird was replying to the fish 
Clever one inferior one deaf one with muddled plans fish you should not come out  Roaming the harbor its mouth not eating a storm blowing away fodder  Pig rogue eating its own excrement  
Guard who dwells in a boundup house slithering by itself  The fish burned  for me like fire it sought the place silently  Out of ignorance it got angry it spattered its hands in blood

Possessing the strengthshoulder of a lion sticking out its tongue in the manner of a snake hissing in the manner of   Ninurta king who Enlil made superior to himself  Hero ugal net that overwhelms the enemy 
Ninurta your aura and shade are stretched over the land  Bringing anger to the rebel land gathering up the assembly  Ninurta the king the son who profoundly humbles himself to his father 
When he occupied the throne upon the supreme dais when he bore a great aura  When he initiated a festival when he rejoiced when he sat broadly  When he was rivaling An and Enlil when he was to be sweetened by liquor 
When Bau was to plead with arazu prayers of the king  When Ninurta the son of Enlil was to determine fate  At that time the weapon of the lord looked at the mountain 
arur above on the one hand was speaking to the king  Lord of heavenly station who occupies the dais in the assemblythrone room  Ninurta you utterance never wavers your decreed fate is put faithfully in effect 
My king heaven mated with the verdant earth  Ninurta it gave birth to a warrior that knows no fear the Asag  One that did not sit as a child with a wetnurse who suckled milk by itselfsuckled fear as milk 
My king one that did not know the rearing of a father the slaughterer of the mountain  A youth that has left his scentsweat ie has no odor possessor of a face that has no shame  Ninurta one that lifts itself and rejoices with its form 
My hero who is a bull I shall lean upon  My king it is one who turns to his city acting as a mother  It procreated in the mountains it spread out its seed 
The uu sagkal diorite usium and kagina stones  Hero along with alabaster as warriors they plundered the city 
It grew the tooth of the kuu creature in the mountain  were shakingdragging the trees there  Its power makes the city and its gods bow to the ground  My king this one has cast down a dais its slacked arm does not relent 
Ninurta lord it has decided its cases just like you  Against the Asag against its aura who penetrates with their hand  Who could set out against its great temples 
My lord the mountain has conveyed its nindaba offerings to that place  Hero it has inquired about you because of your father your lineage 
Son of Enlil lord it has sought after your location because of your supreme power  My king it has advised you because of your might  It said Ninurta you shoulder singular warrior never idle 
Its ablebodied young men were chased away into captivityas corpses by themselves for you  The city that has not compelled its people to say the landmountain is for you  Nor has its people said your father  
Despite your holy word being spoken to them may that place back in its tracks  And the city slip away from its wombmatrix ie be stillborn  Its woman will not say pleasant things with her husband 
Nor advise him at night  Nor reveal the purity of her heart  Aroused wild cow eldest child of Suen 
One who validates the cosmic powersrites great queen of queens  One who emerged from the holy womb superior to her birth mother  She is the wise discerning queen of the lands 
Dilimbabbar has not undertaken my case  If he did what is to me If he did not what is it to me 
Victorious he Lugalane drove me out from the temple  Like a swallow he made me fly away from the window my life was consumed  He makes me go in the  brambles of the mountain 
He removed the true crown of the en priestess from my head  Most precious lady loved by An  Most precious lady loved by An 
Beloved spouse of Amauumgalana Dumuzi  Who is the great queen of the horizon and zenith ie the whole of heaven  The Anuna have submitted to you 
Since birth you have been the younger sister of Utu  And thus you have been superior to the Anuna the great gods  The Anuna kiss the ground with their lips for you 
My case has not been finalized but the threat of a hostile decision like my case lingers in my face  The enemy and the evildoer have not escaped its grasp  In the city that has been endowed with truth 
Which has made righteousness and justice into a treasure  Where clean clothes are at the quay  The older brother is to honor the younger brother and behave with humanity 
One is to listen to the word of the father and thus succeeds repays himself  The son is to humbly revere his mother so that he endures until his old age  It is at the holy city and settlement of Enlil 
It is at Nibru the beloved shrine of the Great Mountain  And thus its  of abundance the temple  he raised  Like a towering mountain range he made it grow in a pure place 
Its ruler the Great Mountain father Enlil  In the Ekur the supreme shrine he has sat on its dais  No one can disperse the cosmic powers of that temple

Intelligence is therefore perfected  The true word is therefore made compatible with me  Therefore justice is loved 
Therefore evil is not loved  Therefore the speaking of evil words is hated  I am Shulgi the mighty king who goes out towards the front 
Because I am rejoicing at my might and shoulder strength  I establish the length of the doublehour and had palaces built there at that interval  I establish the length of the doublehour and had palaces built there at that interval 
Therefore shall relax towards its cool side  The male going on the road who otherwise spends the night on the road  Therefore has taken refuge there as if it was his built city 
So that my name is established to distant time so that it is not dropped byfrom the mouth  So that my praise is performed in the land  I am possessed of speed I muster up my strength I am  running 
From Nibru to the brickwork of Urim  My heart therefore spoke to me in order to make a round trip as if it was only one doublehour  A pirig creature not tiring by means of its youth I am one who stands in its strength 
Therefore like a  wild dove flying furiously I pumped my arms  Therefore like the Anzud bird raising its eye towards its mountain I spread my knees apart in stride  Therefore the cities of the land that I founded served me 
Therefore my blackheaded people teeming like ewes look to me sweetly  Like a goat of the mountain range that is to run to its dwelling  As Utu broadening the daylight upon the settlements 
Therefore I was entering the Ekinugal temple  Therefore the templecourtyard of Suen the cattlepen of great amounts of butter was heaped up with abundance  Therefore bulls were slaughtered there sheep were slaughtered there 
Therefore the tigi drum the good thing was played properly there  I am Shulgi the one who makes anythingfood numerous and therefore food offerings were offered there  When I roused myself from the  cultic area like a pirig creature 
Therefore the howling storm shook the ground  Ikur shouted in the broad heavens 
Therefore the rain of heaven mingled with lit embraced the water below  Its small and large hailstones  Therefore made a thud on my back 
I am a king who therefore could not be frightened or have gooseflesh  Like a fierce pirig creature I therefore snarled  Therefore as an equid of the plain I galloped 
Therefore with my heart with happiness inside of it I was running  When I ran as a perfect male donkey  Utu was to look towards his house at sunset 
And thus I had made the round trip the journey being 15 doublehours  My sagursag performers saw the feat  It was one day I performed the ee festival in both Nibru and Urim

From Nibru to the brickwork of Urim  Therefore my heart resolved to make the round trip as if the journey was one doublehour  A pirig creature not tiring by means of its youth I am one who stands by itself 
Like a  wild dove flying furiously I pumped my arms  Therefore like the Anzud bird raising its eye towards its mountain I spread my knees apart in stride  Therefore the cities of the land that I founded stood for me 
Like a goat of the mountain range that is running to its dwelling  As Utu broadening the daylight upon the settlements  Therefore I was entering the Ekinugal temple 
Therefore the temple of Suen the cattlepen of great amounts of butter was filled with abundance  Therefore bulls were slaughtered there sheep were slaughtered there  Therefore the em and ala drums resounded 
Therefore the tigi drum the good thing functioned properly there  I am Shulgi the one who makes anythingfood numerous and therefore I offered food offerings there  When I roused myself from the  cultic area like a pirig creature 
Therefore I relaxed there I bathed there with flowing water  Therefore I bend the knee there and ate food there  Therefore I was arising like a harrier and a falcon 
Therefore I was returning towards Nibru in my exuberance  At that time the storm therefore shouted the stormwind circled  Therefore the north and south winds howled by themselves 
Therefore flashing lighting wreaked havoc in heaven together with the seven winds  The beautiful Nanibgal Nisaba  Gave wisdom and intelligence generously to me 
I am experienced scribe who does not ignore lit pass by anything  When I rose as if possessing the musculature of a leopard  When I galloped mightily like a nisku equid 
The heart of An brought rejoicing for me  In my happiness Enlil spoke truthfully to me  They gave me a scepter because of my justice 
I was able to step on the neck of the lands   put the fame of my weapon to the Lowland   put news of my conquests to the highland 
After I go out into combat and battle  To the place that Enil has grown angry at   I go at the front of my troops 
I illuminate the area lit field that I see  It is I who puts passion into the weapon  I am in possession of the spear and the masatum weapon 
I know the slingstone of the sling ie how to load it  My discharged destructive clay bullets and pellets  The ones that are to fly like an aura bearing northern storm 
In my anger I do not let them pass their mark  I give fear and distress to the enemy land  My brother and friend who is the youth Utu 
I am Shulgi I speak a word with him openly  He is the beautifulfaced god of my battle  The youth Utu who makes a brother love a brother is the protective spirit of my weapon 
As ie like my brother and friend Utu  Of my ones standing with shoulders like a pirig creature  Of my dust covered equids screaming like ug creatures I am their good groom 
Like a male donkey my strength never wavers as a runner  I come out ahead from the other runners  I bear no sin I jump around continually in mirth 
My word is something never to be abandoned by the mouth  My praise is present in the mouth on my behalf manifested in legal decisions of truth  I am a ritually pure diviner 
In order to perfect the lustration rites of the iib priesthood  In order to praise the en priestess and install her on behalf of the gipar building  In order to choose the lumah priest and eredigir priestess in the holy heart 
To advance towards the lowland and inflict defeat against the highland  To open the house of the emblem  To wash the lance with the water of battle 
To enact clever plans in the rebel land  The words of the gods is a most precious thing for these matters  After I establish an oracular utterance within the white lamb the sheep suitable for extispicy 
My diviner  there like a barbarian  The prepared sheep passes into my hand 
I do not hold good omens with bad omens  A brilliant mind is mine I go by my own eyes  I am the king the entrails of a single sheep 
I see the orders of the whole world  I shall boast about my deeds  I have made the reputation of my might spread wide 
And therefore I am devoted to the art of the musician  Nothing about it is blocked to me  I have learned the depth and width of tigi and adab songs or instruments perfected byequipped for the musicians craft 
The playing of the ukar instrument was grasped in the mind  In order to adjust the frets I did not cause the arm to break  I made plans fordrew its raising and lowering 
I have known how to tune the three  gu instrument and the lyre well  I have known the three stringed instrument and the heart of the art of the musician soundbox and the howling heart  I have known the fingering techniqueplectrum of the algar and sabitum instruments which the king created 
The lion instrument the post of the boatman instrument and zanaru instrument I brought out their noises   Like a purehandedskilled member of the musicians 
If someone brings a gudi instument never heard before to where I am my place  When I make it speak its essence is made known  I can make it like something at its appropriate time 
Finding the sound by tightening slackening and correcting has not escaped my hand  I do not play the reed flute like a mere reed pipe of the shepherd  Intoning a umuna song wailing in lament 
I am one who spends the day in joy and princeliness  If a man pays attention to his fear 
The matter that which the eye surveys  The circumscribed limits of life  The bilepoison of the landnetherworld of oppression a man cannot cast aside 
He is one who trusts in his own might  And thus one who trusts his great name  Makes everything the best why would he diminish them 
My words are the finest of pressedhigh quality oils  A heart that burns like fireI have known its cooling 
One will weigh my words against a man excessive in words  I am a man of the most precious things  The importance of being humbled is appreciated by me 
One cannot slanderalter anything of mine  By the word of An and Enlil  I shall cover my mouth in submission for the life of the homeland and the life of the foreign lands 
I too have known how to serve the gods  I have known the cooling place of the Anuna  I am Shulgi whose great neck grows thick in princeliness 
When I am able to have great things  Rejoicing is able to be in my heart  I am one who will not cast that which is being brought to an end aside 
Or a single king from ancient times  Thus I am not plotting violence against him  That which accrued after mankind was placed from heaven on the earth 
I am not a barbarian regarding this accumulated knowledge  From cultic songs of the present time to ancient ones of distant days  Therefore when I  the tigi and zamzam songsinstruments 
At no time have I chosen themuttered falsely or blocked them in the mouth  Therefore I have inquired after these ancient things and not given them over to be abandoned  Therefore I made my irgida songs manifest in my good palacetemple 
Therefore the  of the tigi and zamzam songsinstruments everything I embedded in my memory  That which was thus not dropped from the hand   will not release 
 will not release   the wisdomear of the land daily 
 the wisdomear of the land daily   the wisdomear of the land daily   until distant years  
 his heavy tribute  distant years   until distant years  Looking at

Therefore he sent longfleeced sheep and  ewes straight to me  From the highland his far away place  
Therefore he brought cedar juniper cypress and boxwood to me by themselves  Enlil my king who makes the lands  submit  Therefore he made the people take to a single path for me he made them into a unified voice for me 
It is me I am present facing Enlil I am the beloved of the Ekur  After Sumer and Akkad had been dispersed  In the Ekurzagin temple of Enlil in the Egageua temple of Ninlil 
Therefore no king had brought a statue inside for himher  Thus by means of the loving heart of Enlil the Enamtila temple was opened for me  Thus great amounts of treasure were brought straight into the Ekur temple 
Thus everlasting things were piled up in the treasury  A throne whose limbs were limbs of exceeding quality was thus set up for Enlil my king  In the Egageua temple of the Kiur the great place 
A throne of Ninlil was thus set up  I am ImeDagan the son of Dagan  The throne of the seven  enclosures inlaid with  nirigi and uba stones  
 was thus set up for Enlil my king  It is the 3rd time in a series  The composition with the incipit Enlil exceedingly 
I am the unceasing one serving Nuska  I am one whose hand is oriented towards the Kiur 
I am the fitting one for carrying things and running  I am one constantly hurrying but whose knees do not tire  I am the bringer of the nesag offering who does not allow light to pass through the Ebabbar temple 
I am the one who chases abundance towardson behalf of Nippur  In Ke I am the one serving as its iib priest  On behalf of Urim I am the first rate butter and cream 
I am the one given life by the Ekur temple  I am the one who wishes for vitality on behalf of his city 
I am lipitItar the shepherd of the lands  I am the king a wave thrashing towards battle  I am one who does not loosen the knots of the bindings of youthfulness 
I am the sagkal stone the stone that   I am a shield the watcher of the army 
I am the brightfaced hero who solidifies the troop formation  I am lipitItar the son of Enlil  I am a waterskin of cold water the life of the young manworker 
I am the one who watches the campaign the protective shade of the troops  I am a king that when he sits he goes on the dais  I put important thoughts to words 
I am one who possesses profound thought and broad understanding  Longtablet of Ningezida 
I am the one sharpening the giriura knife  In battle I am the one flashing like lightning  I am the one who secured the foundations of the land and repulse the enemy troops 
I am the sagkal stone the stone that   I am a shield the watcher of the army  I am the brightfaced hero who solidifies the troop formation 
I am LipitItar the son of Enlil  I am a waterskin of cold water the life of the young manworker  I am the one who watches the campaign the protective shade of the troops 
I put important thoughts to words  I am one who possesses profound intellect and counsel seeking the correct way  I am one who does not hurry anything seeking its end instead 
I am one who possesses profound thought and broad understanding  I am emery that which perforates emerging from the peopleland  I am the one who hasputs truth in the mouth 
I am one who does not destroy eternal justice  I am judge who sets affairs straight when he is to make a decision  I am adept at giving orders to the lands 
I am LipitItar who sets the people in order  In my palace of kingship the pure and sweet dwelling  My spouse holy Inanna 
She established the foundation of my throne there for me  And therefore she will embrace me until distant time and faroff days  In the sweet bedroom the place where the heart rejoices 
For the lady I will spend the day with her  I am LipitItar the mighty heir  I am the king who makes justice manifest 
I am LipitItar the son of Enlil  My praise is sweet

His Abbagenas cultivators and oxdrivers  to harvest the barley were given to him Abbagena   Dadaga for an inspection went there 
and found out that from the labor troop no more than 3 were in service  One Abbagena 
one Urulpae and  and one Ayakalla  not 1 of them as the person in charge was in service  
In the statement of Abbagena  before the governor it was confirmed  At the poplar field

The year in which King RimAnum  the forces of the land of Emutbalum the armies of Eshnunna Isin and Kazallu as if all together with him

and by his power ejected them all from the homeland

You are the one who has desired the mountain range of Ebih but what will its midst accomplish  The abodestation of the gods is imposed with a furious aura 
And thus a radiance is released upon the holy dwelling of the Anuna  The redfurious aura of the mountain range is imposed upon the lands 
Its height is of heaven its horn brought out  
She opened the house of battle  She pushed the door of lapis 
She brought out supreme battle she founded a great storm 
The woman levelled the bowstring with the supreme arrow  Holy Inanna clutched the quiver 
The risen stormwind raised up devastation  A risen evil wind was  potsherds 
Holy Inanna acted as her pleasure  She wentstood among the mountain range of Ebih and spoke to him 
Mountain range on account of your raising on account of your being high  On account of your being beautiful on account of your being verdant  On account of your wearing the holy ba garment 
On account of your setting a hand straight away into heaven  On account of your not bringing your nose close to the ground 
On account of your not dragging your beard in the dust  They killed you and one of them stripped you naked 
Like an elephant one seized your tusks  Like a great wild bull like a thick horned one  touched the ground  
Like a bull I cast down  towards your massive horns  founded hatred for you 
 filled your eyes with weeping   placed lamentation in your heart  In is outskirts the bird of despair founded a nest 
A 2nd time she made a wishrejoiced at the furious aura she boasted faithfully  My father Enlil has imposed my great aura in the lands 
He placed a weapon at my right arm  At my left arm I  on a sealtablet 
My rage a harrow with large teeth tears apart the mountain 
 built a palace and did surpassing things 
 set up a throne there I will make its foundations firm   gave the knife and the dagger to the kurgara performer 
 gave the em and lilis drums to the lamentation priest   exchanged the head of the pilpili functionary 
My triumph went against the mountain  My triumph went against Ebih 
Like an overflowing flood it broughtpoured high waterirrigated the u land  Like a rising flood it twisted ie cleaned the immense cloth 
My triumph stood in the mountain  My triumph stood in Ebih

In order that flax grows and barley spreads wide  In order that the spring carpflood is established in the harbor 
In order that the land perpetuates in abundance  In order that that Summer makes a knot in heaven blocking rain 
In order that Winter establishes water in the quay in abundance  Enlil the king of the lands resolved

They were libating brotherhood and friendship like fine oil  In order to discuss good matters in their midst together they were pleasant 
Both Summer and Winter held an adamin contest  Winter the true farmer of Enlil

In the plain he gave the means of eating and drinking to living creatures  Enki the lord of abundance the lord of the gods stationed  at its side in charge 
Nudimmud the supreme prince the lord of broad wisdom  After he created both the fish and the bird 
He filled the marsh and reedbed with them  He chose their station on behalf of you   He made their eyes discover their design 
At that time the fish laid eggs in the deep watermarsh  The bird founded a nest at the intake of the reed bed 
The bird terrified the fish in the deep watermarsh by means of its scream  The fish stood he was shouting to the bird  It was boasting by means of a fight he intiated a quarrel 
It arose in the street in the manner of a quarrel it stood there wildly  At that time the fish was speaking to the bird in the deep watermarsh with an outcry 
Bird releasing ie uninhibited shouting  was not presentplaced  Croaker of the deep watermarsh screaming releasing and growingboasting the lips perhaps an ideophone 
Spending time eating way too much having horrible diarrhea  You may be able to croakchew when you stand in the plain but they will chase you away 
In the furrow the members of the ranks of farmers should not cease  a net for you 
The gardener should not cease setting up a net in the irrigated orchard for you  His arm is not set apart to rest from the sling he does not bend his knee to sit because of you 
You are one who is destroying thingsfood in the garden you are one who cannot sweeten the flesh of the land  Your feet are not good for fields that have wet patches 
Bird shameless one who sprinkle feces in the courtyard 
The young sweeper who is sweeping in the temple is braiding a malevolent rope there for you 
The palace is confused by your scream it is to be abandoned by the agency of your mouth  They bring one of your kind into the fatteners shed 
They make one of your kind babble like livestock  They pour cold water into the watering trough for you 
You can then be accepted as a regular offering  The fowler delivers one of your kind with bound wings 
The fisherman brings one of your kind into the palace  They cripple your wingsfeathers and faceeyes 
Your shouting has no limit what is your flying 
By means of your horrible cry you frighten the night one does not sleep well 
Bird leave the marsh remove your scream from above me 
Bring out a pit in the sand dunes thus is what is appropriate for you 
At that time the fish insulted the bird  Because of its beauty the bird knew about its multicolored back and multicolored face 
Whatever insults fish had assailed it with it did not ponder them  It was as if a nursemaid was singing a lullaby 
It was not heeding these words laughing malevolently instead 
At that time the bird was replying to the fish  Thus your heart produces exuberance you have actually humilated yourself 
Your mouth is a hole which  surrounded with teeth you cannot see your back 
Possessor of blunted limbs and blunted appendages turn your neck by means of the fins 
Possessor of a smell that is not good inducing vomiting opening the mouth and wrinkling of the nose 
No one holdscatches your eating ie food properly with a caulked container or a cord 
Your plunderer does not touch his hand to his skin  Total 63 lines

In the furrow the members of the ranks of farmers should not cease  a net for you  The gardener should not cease setting up a net towards the irrigated orchard for you

You frighten the night one does not sleep well  Bird leave the marsh remove your scream from above me 
Bring out a pit in the sand dunes thus is your appropriate role 
At that time the fish insulted the bird  Because of it beauty the bird knew about its multicolored back and multicolored face 
Whatever insults fish had assailed it with it did not ponder them  It was as if a nursemaid sang a lullaby 
It was not devoting itself to words laughing malevolently instead 
At that time the birds was replying to the fish  Thus your heart produces exuberance you are actually humiliating yourself 
Your mouth is a hole which  surrounded with teeth you cannot see before yourself 
No one holdscatches your eating ie food properly with reed a cord or a caulked container 
Your plunderer does not touch his hand to his skin  In the great swamp in the broad marsh I am your ranger 
One cannot eat its good food because of me my voice approaches there  One cannot move in the rivercanal confidently my south wind covers completely 
From before me they are diving into the reedbed and marsh  From among your little ones you might as well pile up for me as a regular offering for my sustenance  
Your large ones are indeed the solution of the site of a banquet  I am the beautiful and knowledgable bird 
Beautiful work occurred on behalf of my adornment  But there is no one who has prepared the working of your pure waxmold 
In the palace of the king I am the ornament of movement  In the courtyard my noise is a fitting thing one established it as suchset it apart 
My cry is that of a sweet thing  On the body of Shulgi it is a fitting thing one established it as suchset it apart 
Fruits of the orchard are for my many regular offerings 
babaza porridge malt hulled grain and emmer flour are for my thingsfood that sweetens the mouth 
Thus you do not know my greatness Bow your neck to the ground 
At that time the bird insulted the fish  The fish possessed of anger trusting in the heroic might of the deep water 
Like a heavy rain cloud it touched the ground it stood in an adamin contest 
Whatever insults the bird had struck it with it did not ponder 
It was able to set its neck on the ground sarcastically it was speaking freelyhumbly 
For the 2nd time the fish replied to the bird  Bird you do not know my greatness you did not tread behind me you are one who has not inquired after me 
You cannot know either my weakness or my strength you have spoken an inflammatory word  Possessor of trimmed limbs crippled feet a  mouthbeak and a thinned outflattened tongue 
By means of ignorance you have been able to sneershoutchew but you have not advised yourself 
I the fish am the one who piles up the abundance of the pure shrinesea together 
I am the one who bringsgoesstands among the great nindaba offerings of the Ekur proudly 
Like the grain goddess Ezina I am here for the sustenance of the land I am her helper  The harvest rejoices with me as if it was a festival my inquirer is there 
Bird what is your great thing that you accomplished I will make you known your over exuberance 
I want to return back into your mind your arrogance and mendacious speech 
At that time the fish was to make plans against the bird  Silently and deceptively it went on its arms 
When the bird got up from its nest in order to bring back food for its chick 
The fish sought the place silently  It struck the birds established nest its prepared plants making it a windswept shrine 
It destroyed its built house it tore out its storeroom  It killed its eggs and its nest with water it covered them in the sea 
For a 2nd time the fish insulted the bird  At that time the bird with the face of a pirig creature and the claws of a hurin bird 
It was beating its wings towards its nest but its flight path was blocked 
With its mouth it was screaming in the midst of heaven like the nugig midwife of heaven ie Inanna  At that time the bird which was looking carefully its limbs were spread out 
Like a stormwind that is to shake to the midst of heaven it roamed in heaven  The bird was searching the fish in the deep water it sought it in the marshes 
The bird saw the fish in the deep water and planned against it 
It seized it it tried to flee in the water but the bird held it with its claws  It heaped up its little spawn together it heaped them in the manner of sheaves 
The bird took out revenge but its heart was not cooling 
For a 2nd time the bird was replying to the fish  Clever one inferior one deaf one with muddled plans fish you should not come out 
Roaming the harbor its mouth not eating a storm blowing away fodder 
Pig rogue eating its own excrement  
Guard who dwells in a boundup house slithering by itself 
The fish burned  for me like fire it sought the place silently 
Out of ignorance it got angry it spattered its hands in blood 
In making itself feel wonderful it has destroyed itself 
I am the one who flies in heaven I am the one who goes about on earth 
Wherever I am going whatever is its name I am the happiness that is present on behalf of   Month of baragzaggar day

It was able to submit furiously it was speaking freelyhumbly 
A 2dind time fish was answering the bird  Possessor of trimmed limbs crippled feet a  mouthbeak and a thinned outflattened tongue 
By means of ignorance you have been able to sneershoutchew but you yourself have not contemplated 
Eating way too much  filling the courtyard with feces 
The young courtyard sweeper who is sweeping in the temple is braiding a rope for you 
The cook the brewer and the gatekeeper who reside in the temple are distressed with you 
Bird you are one who my greatness does not tread behind you are one who does not inquire after me 
You cannot know either my weakness or my strength you have conversed in an inflammatory manner 
You have not sought the site of my deeds now humble yourself excessively 
Your word has brought release you have not taken counsel with yourself 
I the fish am the one who piles up the abundance of the pure shrinesea together 
At The supreme mound I am the one who bringsgoesstands among the great nindaba offerings of the gods proudly 
Like the grain goddess Anan I am here as the sustenance of the land I am her helper 
The people have listened to me they have looked to me  The land rejoices with me as if it was a festival my inquirer is there 
Bird what is your great thing that you accomplished I will make you know your over exuberance  I want to give back into your hand your arrogance and false speech 
At that time the fish was setting plans in place against the bird  Silently and deceptively it went on its arms 
When the bird got up from its nest in order to bring back food for its chick 
The fish sought the place silently on its arms 
The mounds of mine spread out in the plain are a verdant mountain range bearing an aura  I pile up large and small grain heaps for Enlil  I heap up wheat emmer and gunida for him 
In the storehouse of humanity I fill up with a mountain  The orphan widow and the destitute have taken gigur baskets for dragging 
They gather the remnants of my ears  With my chaff piled up in the field 
I tow along all humanity  I am able to rear the teeming livestock of Sumuqan 
Hoe one who malevolently burrowed whose blade malevolently tore out  Hoe one bound to work in clay 
Hoe the one whose head is lodged in the field  Hoe one who has spent the day in the mold in clay with no one to clean it 
After the water of the river bound the build houses 
After Enlil frowned at the land  After it came to know the staff of Enlil 
After it was acted upon by the supremacy of Enlil  Enlil did not abandon the land 
He gave the singlebladed hoe to the arid land  You bind us in the winter just as the harvest season 
We flee from the place of summer just like that of winter  The one that binds the arm of the hoe has tied up the sheaves 
The one the binds the arm of the bird snare has tied up the dragged gigur basket  It has reared the solitary young man and the destitute person 
They gather the remnants of my ears  The millstone laid down for me the mortar thrashed for me 
It is being smitten by the pestle  The aur and mansim sieves compete to see who works the hardest  Why does the man act angrilyWhat are these acts that a man does angrily 
I fill the meadows with water  When the reedbed is irrigatedflooded  When a canal is cut open when the ditch is cut open when water as a great flooding river imposes water 
The carrying basket my little one is put down with me to workdoes not bend down with you  When in the marsh an edge is made 
I the hoe serve comprehensively in these situations  Neither the southern nor the northern wind tear apart my work there 
The fowler gathers eggs  The fisherman catches fish 
The people have taken the bird hoop traps that have sprung  Now my abundance sprinkles with its hands in the lands  After the water has been cut off from the meadow 
After the water has been set downmaterializes for working the damp ground  Plow before you I emerge in the field 
For you I loosen the set aside field  In the hideout of the dike I cut away the weeds for you 
I remove the ukul weed in the field  I collect the deadold reeds and the roots for you in the field 
The field working crew set in the path for you  Six oxen four men and you are the 11th  The labor of my preparation as a tool takes away  
When you go out in the field apart from me  One cannot look favorably upon your furrow which is alone 
When you lodge your head in the ground working  You are bound to  roots and thorns 
When you break your ploughshare and recreate your ploughshare your ploughshare does not  at your disposal 
Your farmer names you this plow is finished  Again a carpenter is hired for you a leatherworker is hired for you 
The house of the artisans scurry around  for you  I the feltworker cut the teasel brush for you 
He brings up a twisting picket for you  And therefore he is to exhaust the braiding lever for you  A piece of leather not cut into strips is made to sit towards your head 
Your raisingcarrying is small but your way is supreme  The day of the new year is ie begins a period of twelve months 
But your service time is four months per year  Your fugitive ie absentee time is eight months per year 
As many as your served time it is two times you go elsewhere  On your raftfreight boat you pile up a cabin 
When you set yourself in place there and you removeaccept the beams  When you remove your facefront from the water like a vessel of wine 
When I prepare a pile lit mountain by means of the beams  My smoke makes  green in the house 
Your seed funnel where is it cast  I am the hoe I shall  along with  in the city  I am one who has extended the cattlepen I am one who has broadened the sheepfold 
I am a servant who has followed his master  I am one who always builtrennovated the house of his master 
I stir clay I spread it out to make bricks  I lay foundations I build houses 
I follow the foundation of an old wall 
 built a house for you  built a storeroom for you   built a house that is more than a house a long sided sheepfold for you 
In the house  pots and poured good quality beer in them 
 put sweet beer up to the fence  So that your acquaintances come towards you so that your friends come towards you 
Do not abandon the child of your friend  Enter it for me my beloved child 
Enter it for me my beautiful child  Dont spend the day idle dont spend the night idle 
Do not bring moonlight into the house  As I have spent the day as I have spent the night 
The one who enters is pacified there the area has been made appropriate for you  Sitting down in its midst is set in order for you 
My fish so that my ones who sleep there do not wake up  So that my ones who dwell there do not quarrel

In Eridu he built the temple on the riverbank  Its brickwork speaks words and gives advice 
Its reed layers within the brick bellowed like a bull  The temple of Enki is to shout nobly 
The temple brought praise at night for the king while presenting it sweetlybending its knee to him  For Enki the vizier Isimud was speaking

The bird sets foottreads there  The suhur carp plays in the ulal plants 
The etub carp flap their tails for him towards the tiny gizi reed grouth  When Enki rises the fish rise as a wave 
In the Abzu he stands amid admiration  In the Eengura temple rejoicing  
Like the sea he can possess an aura  He is a supreme river who can cast a radiance 
In the Euphrates river he can raise a furious southern wind  His boat pole is his serpent Nera 
His oars are his little kib birds  When Enki sails the year is filled with abundance 
The boat released itself and seized its own ropes 
After he fled towards the temple of Eridu  In the river  was advising its king 
The one whose voice was the voice of a calf the voice of a sweet cow 
Enki was slaughtering bulls and slaughtering sheep  He restored the ala drum that was not present to its proper place

The people were circling around like water poured into a wellpond 
Its strength was not present in its aura and thus its strength did not dwell there  Enlil made starvation in the form of an evil person dwell in the city 
He made that which destroys cities that which destroys temples dwell in the city 
He made that which before it a weapon does not stand against dwell in the city 
He made the hungryunsatfisfied and the eyeroller dwell in the city  In Ur even the feardisdain of head shaking like a single planted reed was not established 
Its people took refuge like a caught fish 
Meager and great alike spread out no one arosewas mustered  The king was mounted atop the gate tower there was no food there for him 
The king who had ate and drank good things had to now clutch at a mere ration 
The sun was clouded over one was being enviouswatching and knew fasting 
There was no beer in the house of the plain its  was not present  There was no food for him in his palace it was not good for dwelling 
His supreme storehouse was not filled with grain no one could take refuge there 
The grain goddess was not present in the large and small grain heaps 
The afternoon meal of the gods was not eaten funerary offerings   In the great banquet the honeyed liquor and  wine ceased 
The giriPAa knife that consumes oxen and sheep  
In the great oven the oxen and sheep were not being prepared ie roasted one could no longer smell it  The crybreath of the purearmed bursag buildingfunctionary stopped 
The temple that had once belowed like a bull  silently   did not execute deliveries properly  
The millstone the mortar and the pestle sat idle no one bends down towards them  In the lapis harbor of Nanna boats were bound in the water due to silt 
The water of the prow did not scream it did not cast joy  Sand was piled up in the unuRIbanda buildingshrine of Nanna 
The  rushes grew the  rushes grew the reed of mourning grew  Boats and barges quit the shining harbor 
Enlil made starvation in the form of an evil person dwell in the city 
He made that which destroys cities that which destroys temples dwell in the city 
He made that which before it a weapon does not stand against dwell in the city 
He made the hungrydissatisfied and the eyeroller dwell in the city

The king who had ate and drank good things had to now clutch at a mere ration  The sun was clouded over one was being enviouswatching and knew fasting

His supreme storehouse was not filled with grain no one could take refuge there 
The grain goddess was not present in the large and small grain heaps 
The afternoon meal of the gods was actively diminished there  In the great banquet the honeyed liquor ceased 
As for the giriPAa knife that consumes oxen and sheep it lay abandoned in the plants 
In the great oven the oxen and sheep were not being prepared ie roasted one could no longer smell it 
The crybreath of the purearmed bursag buildingfunctionary stopped 
The temple that had once belowed like a bull  silently 
The deposit of the properly executed deliveries was a distant memory 
The millstone the mortar and the pestle sat idle no one bends down towards them 
In the lapis harbor of Nanna boats were bound in the water due to silt  The water of the prow did not scream it did not cast joy 
Sand was piled up in the unuRIbanda buildingshrine of Nanna  The  rushes grew the  rushes grew the reed of mourning grew 
Boats and barges quit the shining harbor 
In your canal that was made suitable for barges no one was rowing anymore  The plans of the festival at the place of rites was changed 
The nesag offering ships of his birth father Enlil no longer brought the nesag offering 
 could not bring its nindaba offerings to Nibru for him  There was emptiness in the rivercanal barges were not traversing it 
No foot was setpresent on its two banks tall plants grew 
The fence of the broad cattle pen of Nanna was torn apart  The reed fence of the orchard was   established a breach 
The cow was seized along with its calf  The munzer fed cows took to a strange path in an unknown part of the plain 
Gayau who loves cows dropped his weapon in the beddingdung 
unidug the one who stores butter and cheese did not store butter and cheese 
People who did not know butter were churning its butter  People who did not know milk were  its milk 
In the cattle pen the churning churn was not bellowing nobly 
The heavy coals that had been lit their smoke ceased  Suen wept to his father Enlil 
My birth father my city was  for youhim why did you turn away from me 
Enlil my Ur was  for youhim why did you turn away from me  The nesag offering ships of his birth father no longer brought the nesag offering for him 
 could not bring its nindaba offerings to Enlil at Nibru for him  The winds carried off the en priestess of the outer city and the en priestess of the inner city 
Ur like a city struck by a hoe has been broken up into ruin heaps 
The Kiur shrine the place of relaxation of Enlil has been made into a windblown shrine 
Enlil  your eye at your city it is an empty wasteland 
The dogs of Ur are not sniffing at the base of the city wall 
The one who burrowsdemarcates wells is not gathering earth at the market price  My birth father turn around my city back to your arms from its loneliness 
Enlil turn around my Ur back to your arms from its loneliness  Turn around my Ekinugal temple back to your arms from its loneliness 
So that my Ur is brought out so that the people are broadened  So that he returns the me of Sumer which were destroyed to their place 
It is the 3rd kirugu 
Alas the true temple the true temple its man its man 
It is the gegigal response  Enlil was replying to his son Suen

Longtablet of Damqiiliu 
Month Abe 21st day 
Enlil was replying to his son Suen  In the  of of the windswept city the reed of mourning grows in lamentation 
In the  the reed of mourning grows in lamentation  In the  he spends time in lamentation 
My son if you yourself are a native son then it is you who is the one whose tears they are  Nanna if you yourself are a native son then it is you who is the one whose tears they are 
There is no revocation of a final verdict the word of the assembly 
The uttered word of An and Enlil knows no change 
If Ur was given kingship  did not give an eternal term of office 
From the distant day when the land was founded to the current limit of teeming people 
Who has seen a reign of kingship taking precedence forever 
In order to lengthen the term of kingship in order to take counsel to that effect  My Nanna do not become exhausted doing this leave your city 
At that time my king the native son quitkilled his liverlungs  Lord Dilimbabbar fashioned a destroyedevil heart 
Nanna who loved his city left his city 
Ningal in order to go as a stranger of her city to a strange place 
Hurriedly she got dressedbraided a rope for escape and left the city  The Anuna of Ur stood outside 
In Ur fire that  by itself was extinguished 
In Ur its trees were sick its reeds were sick  A lament was competing with the wall up to its circuit in terms of completeness 
Daily weapons were smashing heads before it  In Ur great hazin axes were sharpened before it 
They were setting the spears the arms of battle in order  Great bows throw sticks and shields were consuming together 
Barbed arrows filled its outside like a rainstorm 
Great stones made a thudding pudpad noise by themselves  Daily an evil wind returns among the city 
In Ur the noble one divested of his strength stood among the murderers  The enemy defeated the people those who stood among the weapons 
In the city the ones who did not advance against the weapons dwelledsat in hunger 
Starvation thus filled the city it was not ceasing 
In hunger they were bowing their heads and twisting their muscles  Its people filled the ponds they were  
Its king breathed painfully in his own house 
Its humanity dropped their hands their weapons touched the ground 
They gatheredclasped their hands to their necks they were weeping  Together they advised they discussed 
Alas what is it that we will say what is it that we will add  How long until we are to be finished in the mouth of catastrophe 
The inside of Ur is death the outside is death  How long until we are to be finished within that of starvation inside the city 
How long until we are to be finished among the weapons of Elam outside the city  The enemy stands in Ur we must come to an end 
Acting on behalf of their life and their back they spoke together 
They opened the bolt of the gate the storm was making its door stand in the street 
Elam set foot there like a great onrushing flood 
In Ur they were crushing their heads with weapons like a porous pot 
They could not sprint away as fugitives they were seized within the walls limits 
Like fish living in a pond they were seeking refuge  The enemy dwelled in the Ekinugal temple of Nanna 
They were breaking the holy having heavy possessions bird  They cut down the statue that occupied the uzga shrine 
Nineigara the supreme steward abandoned the storehouse 
Its throne was covered over from the front she could only sit in the dust instead  They seized the great cows atby their  horns  cut their horns off 
 smote goring bulls with the weapon like they were grazing sheep 
 was cut down and bound together like a date palm  The date palm of like strong copper the arm of heroism 
It was torn out like a rush it was cut like a rush it was turned sideways in its roots 
Its top was lodged in the ground a person to raise it was not available 
 trimmed its midribs and set its top on fire 
 its spadix with ripe dates  the well  The gizi reed that grew in the holy  were actively diminished 
Total Sixty lines  
The gizi reeds that grew in the holy enclosure were actively diminished 
The enemy carried away the great tribute that  deposited there  In the temple its gebur ormanment fell its parapet was destroyed 
 embracing on its right and left  Like smitten heroes they were covered from the front 
Its great stormdemon with an open mouth and the face of an awebearing pirig creature 
 were felling them with a saman rope like a caught wild bull enemy territory  
 brought the scent of the dwelling of holy Nanna which was like a juniper forest to an end 
Its asalbar feature the one that was overlaid with gold and lapis   And the awe of the temple which had been goodthe awe was now destroyed 
The one that had filled the lands like sunlight was rebuilt like the evening of heaven instead 
Its door the one that  sunlight like a beautifulverdant star of heavenconstellation 
And the great boundary stakes shouted so that  would not tear them out  Its hinge  was defiled with a stunned silence 
Together with its door fitting it wept like a fugitive  The holy bolt and bar were no longer fixed oncontrolling the great door 
The noise of the previously fixedcontrolled door fell silent it had no one to fixcontrol it 
 was actively diminished it set  in the broad street 
In the royal offering place the nindaba offering of the royal offering place was changed  In its holy  was not making the tigi em and ala drums sound nobly 
Among its supreme tigi drums the aua functionary did not sing pure songs 
At the gate tower where fates are to be determined there were no affairs 
The throne where cases had been decided no longer stood cases were not undertaken correctly 
NannaSuens vizier Alamu dropped the scepter with his hand shaking  In the holy bed chamber of Nanna  shall not  at his feet 
The holy treasure box which no one is to see the enemy saw inside of it 
 did not set up the pure bedbed of flowers  did not spread out shining plants upon it 
They were cutting down the statue that occupied the uzga shrine  The dream interpreter the engiz temple cook and the seal bearer did not use the eda vessel properly 
In the holy uzga shrine the agadala priests of the pure washing rites  They stood in the manner of one whose neck is pushed to the ground the enemies took them away 
Suen brought his  there for his father 
He knelt there before his birth father Enlil  My birth father how long will the eye of the enemy have looked at my  how long  
On my hair bound up with the suh headresspectoral  The great cleaned pure day has become dirty  
Examine faithfully your heart darkened by anger which terrifies like a wave 
Enlil was speaking a true word to his son Suen 
The destroyed city the flattening of the parapet of the great wall by the storm this too is a part of the turn of office 
One who  for the dark days of you term of office may open the temple be spoken 
Previous dweller in your dwelling the Etemenniguru temple which was built faithfully  May  rebuild it  may the people bow down towards it 
May  have bread  at its base may Anan dwell with it  May there be joy in its branches may Utu rejoice with him 
On its   may the abundance of Anan embrace  
May Ur the city decreed by An be returned to its place for you 
May Enlil like a true speaker raise his neck towards heaven 
For Nanna may the high and low land assemble 
For Suen may he set the roads of the land of land in order  With a noise like a rainstorm touching the earth may pounding stones be employed for him 
It was the spoken word of An and Enlil and therefore it was being carried out faithfully 
Father Nanna stood in his city Ur with head held high 
The youth Suen was able to enter into his Ekinugal temple  Ningal was relaxing in her pure chamber 
He was able to enter into Ur into his Ekinugal temple  It is the 4th kirugu  The city was an empty wind in its midst the reed of lamentation grew in lament 
In its midst the reed of lamentation grew in lament  Its people spend the day in lamentation 
It is its gegigal response  Bitter storm raise you chest depart turn backconfine yourself in your house 
Month Harvest 18th day 
The throne where cases had been decided no longer stood cases were not undertaken correctly  NannaSuens vizier Alamu dropped the scepter with his hand shaking 
In the holy bed chamber of Nanna  he does not  aton his feet  The holy treasure box which no one is to see the enemy saw inside of it 
 did not set up the pure bedbed of flowers  did not spread out shining plants upon it 
They were cutting down the statue that occupied the uzga shrine  The engiz temple cook dream interpreter and seal bearer did not use the eda vessel properly 
They stood in the manner of one whose neck is pushed to the ground the mountaindwellers carried them away 
In the holy uzga shrine the agadala priests of the pure washing rites  They were forsaking the pure plans and the me they went to another city 
Suen brought his ruined heart there for his father  He knelt there before his birth father Enlil 
My birth father how long will the eye of the enemy have looked at the accounts how long  
When you give lordship and kingship do not  towards meon my behalf  Father Enlil the one of the true order and command 
Father Enlil it is the fate that you decreed and therefore no one can release its logic 
On my hair bound up with the suh headresspectoral  Enlil was speaking a true word to his son Suen 
My son a city of abundance was built for you your turn of office sought you out 
The destroyed city the flattening of the parapet of the great wall by the storm this too is a part of the turn of office 
One who  for the dark days of you term of office may open the temple be known 
Previous dweller in your dwelling the Etemenniguru temple which was built faithfully 
May  rebuild it in joy may the people bow down towards it  May  have bread  at its base may Anan rejoice with him 
May  have joy in its branches may Utu rejoice  On its table may the abundance of Anan embrace  
May Ur the city decreed by An be returned to its place for you 
May Enlil who is the true speaker raise his neck towards heaven 
For Nanna may the high and low land assemble 
For Suen may he set the roads of the land of land in order  Touching the ground like a rainstorm  
It was the spoken word of An and Enlil and therefore it was being carried out faithfully 
Nanna stood in his city Ur with head held high 
Suen was able to enter the Ekinugal temple  Ningal was relaxing in her pure chamber 
The youth Suen was able to enter into his Ekinugal temple  Bitter storm storm raise you chest depart storm turn backconfine yourself in your house 
Storm destroyer of cities storm raise you chest depart storm turn backconfine yourself in your house 
Storm destroyer of temples storm raise you chest depart storm turn backconfine yourself in your house 
May the storm that once spent time in Sumer spend time in the other lands instead  May the storm that once spent time in the land spend time in the other lands instead 
May it spend time in the land of Tidnum instead may it spend time in that land  May it spend time in the land of Gutium instead may it spend time in that land 
May it spend time in the land of Anan instead may it spend time in that land  So that in Ur the term of office and abundance last long 
So that the people lay down in the meadows and copulate 
Alas humanity is stricken and gathered up  The princess the one of weeping and lament says 
Nanna alas your city alas your temple alas your humanity

For her the fate of the city approaches she weeps bitterly 
Upon my ladythat of my lady the fate of the temple approaches she weeps bitterly 
The fate of her destroyed city approaches she weeps bitterly 
The fate of her defiled city approaches she weeps bitterly 
The lady after that of the voice the balag drumlyre of lamentation was being founded 
She herself was minimally ie softly intoning an ilu lamentintoning little ilu laments of the silenced  
The storm that is set for me its sorrowwailing hangs upon me  I am the woman whom the storm is set for 
The storm that is set for me its sorrowwailing exhausts me  The storm the bitter storm is set for me 
And therefore I wail because of that storm  Because of the powerwing of the storm I cannot bring out  
And therefore even for a short length of days in my reign propitious days in my reign propitious days  has not seen 
Along with the night because of the power of the night that is set for me  And therefore I wail because of that night 
Because of the powerwing of the night I cannot bring out   The storm that is about to destroy like a flood hangs for me by itselfin its aura 
Because of this in my bed chamber of the night  Calm sleep is not put in my bedchamber of the night 
Because of this the silencing of the bedchamber  If only  would also bring the silencing of the bedchamber 
Because anathema was placed in my land for me  Like a cow with its calf it  the ground 
My land regarding itself does not compare with me  Because bitter toil was placed in my city 
I flap my wings towards it like a bird of the sky  I fly towards my city 
But so to ie nevertheless the city is destroyed where it was founded to my detriment  But so to ie nevertheless Urim is finished in its bedchamber to my detriment 
Because the power of the storm was placed from abovesuperior to me  I screamed and said to him storm you shall stay confined to the steppe 
But the breast of the storm would not rise away from me  Saying The lady they must not put distant days for me into the reign of the Agrunkug temple the temple of my ladyship  Saying The lady they must not put distant days for me into the reign of the Agrunkug temple the temple of my ladyship 
She shall found only weeping and lamentation  Because this temple is the site of liver pleasing of the blackheaded  Anger and distress shall also be doubled on behalf ofby means of its festival to your detriment 
They shall continually bring despair lament and anathema lament and anathema  They shall continually bring despair lament and anathema lament and anathema 
My temple which was established by the just man 
My temple which was established by the just man  Therefore the storm has beaten it at its outside 
In my Ekinugal the temple of kingship  My true temple that initiates lamentation there along with her ie me 
After being built falsely and destroyed truthfully  must not establish as its allocated share for me 
Therefore like a tent a building torn out at the harvest site like a building torn out at the harvest site it was subjected to wind and rain 
Urim my grain storage filled with food  Therefore the empty wind howls in the silent city 
Like the sheepfold of the shepherd it was torn out  The possessions which the city acquired for me are eradicated 
It is the 3rd kirugu refrain  Urim has initiated lamentation to her detriment  Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
It is the gegigal response  At that time this time after the city was flattened  To the detriment of the lady her city is destroyed 
Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment  At that time this time after the city was created 
When they have ordered my city to be destroyed  When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed 
When they have ordered its people to be killed  At that time I will not be indifferent to my city 
I will not neglect my land  For An I shall pour the tears of my eyes 
I shall supplicate myself to Enlil  I shall say to himthem My city must not be destroyed 
I shall say to himthem Urim must not be destroyed  I shall say to himthem Its people must not be killed 
Despite this An did not rescind his word  Despite this the statement It is good so be it of Enlil was not soothing my heart 
Therefore when they have ordered my city to be destroyed  When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed 
When they have ordered its people to be killed  For a 2nd time after they convened an assembly a solemn place 
The Anuna rested on the organized ie finalized word  Therefore I shall extend my limbslap and tie up my hair 
For An I shall pour the tears of my eyes  I shall supplicate myself to Enlil 
I shall say to himthem My city must not be destroyed  I shall say to himthem Urim must not be destroyed 
I shall say to himthem Its people must not be killed  Despite this An did not rescind his word 
Despite this the statement It is good so be it of Enlil was not soothing my heart  Therefore when they have ordered my city to be destroyed 
When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed  When they have ordered its people to be killed 
I as one who gave my advice to my detriment   therefore shall also bind me with my city   therefore shall also bind Urim with me 
An is never to change this word  That which issues from the mouth of Enlil is not to be changed 
It is the 4th kirugu  To the detriment of the lady her city is destroyed  Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
It is the gegigal response  Enlil spoke to the storm and the people wailed 
He deprived the land of days of abundance and the people wailed 
He deprived Sumer of good days and the people wailed 
He commanded the malevolent storm and the people wailed 
He gave them to the kiggal official of the storm his attendant stormwho stood within the storm 
He spoke to the storm annihilating the land and the people wailed 
He spoke to the great storm the one of An and the people wailed 
Enlil was making Gibil fire into his helper  He spoke to the great storm of An and the people wailed 
The great storm was shouting from above and the people wailed 
The storm annihilating the land roared upon the earth  An evil wind overflowing like a great flood which does set down its powerwing 
In the city the weapon was murdering and consuming as if in a pack 
At the base of heaven the storm gnawed and the people wailed 
The storm was burning with fire at its front and the people wailed 
And therefore the raging storm like a fireshade  at its back  Noon which usually raises the rainy wind fog was burning with fire instead 
Midday which usually brings out bright sunlight brought darkness along with it 
The shining sun did not come out in the land it dissipated like the evening 
The southern wind seized the joyful night which initiates the cooling of water 
Burning sherds combined with the soil and the people wailed 
The storm blew a wind upon the blackheaded people and the people wailed 
Sumer was tripping as if in a gebur snare and the people wailed 
The people were erecting a wall of heads the storm devouring as if in a pack 
The bitter storm for which weeping was not decreed as its fate because of this the people wailed 
The eradicatinggathering storm was sweeping the landmaking the land tremble  The storm utterly destroyed the city like a flood 
The storm that was finishing the land established silence in the city 
The storm burning like fire was enraged withcorporeally burned the peopleland 
The storm that is to cause everything to be forgotten stood among the malevolent ones 
The hateful storm ordered by Enlil the storm that  the land 
It covered Ur like a garment spread over it like linen  It is the 5th kirugu 
The storm is a lion thrashing and the people wail 
It is the gegigal response  At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps 
Father Nanna the city has been placed into ruins and the people wailed 
The storm deprived the land of  and the people wailed 
The land was devastated until there was not even a broken sherd and the people wailed 
The storm made a breach in the wall and the people wailed 
At the great gate where there was a path it was piling up corpses 
In the broad lane prepared as if for a festival heads were placed as seeds 
In the streets where there were paths it was piling up corpses  In the playground where there was a festival it spread out people as sheaves 
Ditchesburial pits were put down for the blood of land like it would be done for the drainpipe of heaven 
That of the corpses like sheep fat in sunlight dissolved by themselves 
Like a man ended by a hazin axe one was not bothering to clothe his headwear a turban as a bandage 
Like a goat buck caught by a snare one lodged his mouth in the dirt 
And therefore like a man ended by the mitum weapon one did not bother to wear bandages  As if lying in the birthing place of their mother one laid in his blood 
Those who had not drunk wine nonetheless hung their necks down lit on the shoulder 
Those who served with weaponry were slaughtered by weaponry  The storm took away fugitive men and gazelles alike and the people wailed 
In Urim the weak and strong alike came to an end out of hunger  The elder women and men who did not leave the house were set on fire 
Water brought away the tiny ones  from the lap of the mother like fish 
The strong grasp of the wetnurse this grasp was loosened  Allegiancesense was forgotten and the people wailed 
The treasury of the land was eradicated and the people wailed 
At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps 
Father Nanna the city has been placed into ruins and the people wailed 
The storm deprived the land of  and the people wailed 
The land was devastated until there was not even a broken sherd left and the people wailed 
A breach was made in the wall and the people wailed 
At the great gate where there was a path it was piling up corpses 
In the broad lane prepared as if for a festival heads were placed as seeds 
In the streets where there were paths it was piling up corpses  In the playground where there was a festival it spread out people as sheaves

Those who had not drunk wine nonetheless hung their necks down lit on the shoulder as if drunk 
Those who served with weaponry were slaughtered by weaponry  The storm took away fugitive men and gazelles alike and the people wailed 
In Urim the weak and strong alike came to an end out of hunger  The elder women and men who did not leave the house were set on fire 
Water brought away the tiny ones  the lap of the mother like fish 
The strong grasp of the wetnurse this grasp was loosened  The allegiancesense of the land was forgotten and the people wailed 
The treasury of the land was forgotten and the people wailed 
The mother left her city for to the detriment of her son and the people wailed 
The father turned away from his son and the people wailed 
In the city the spouse was abandoned the child was abandoned possessions were scattered 
The blackheaded people went into s solemn place  The lady left her city like a frightened bird 
Ningal left her city like a frightened bird 
And therefore the possessions  amassed there were annihilated  In the treasury which had possessed  plundered itself 
Even in the ponds Gibil the purifier was performing work 
The high mountain range which no hand approaches oh lord of the Ekinugal temple 
The true temple the great hazin axes were consuming as if in a pack 
The troops of imagi and Elam the destructive ones were treating it as if it was worth thirty shekels 
When the pickaxes struck the true temple and city the people wailed 
They were making the city into ruin heaps and the people wailed 
Its lady was crying Alas my city she was crying Alas my temple 
Ningal was crying Alas my city she was crying Alas my temple 
The woman the storm destroyed her city the storm destroyed her temple 
Nanna shrine Urim is destroyed and the people are scattering 
It is the 6th kirugu  In her cattlepen in her sheepfold the woman shouts bitterly the storm is destoying the city 
It is its gegigal response  Mother Ningal stands apart from her city like an enemy 
The woman cries bitterly about the fate of her destroyed city 
Ningal cries bitterly about the fate of her destroyed temple 
An must curse my city my city must be destroyed 
Enlil must curse my temple the pickaxe must strike 
He must cast fire upon my  coming from the lowland my city must be destroyed 
Enlil must touch down lightning flame upon his highland  At the outskirts of the city the outer city must be destroyed and I shall say Alas my city 
In the middle of the city the inner city must be destroyed and I shall say Alas my city 
My temple in the outskirts of the city is being destroyed and I shall say Alas my city 
My temple in the middle of the city is being destroyed and I shall say Alas my city 
Therefore the city is not pastured for me like a fertile ewe its true shepherd is not present 
Therefore Urim is not pastured for me like a fertile shegoat its herder is not present 
My ox does not stand in the cattlepen its herder is not present  My sheep do not dwell in their sheepfold their herder is not present 
The canal of the city thickens with silt and produces fox dens 
In its course it does not bring flowing water its canal inspector is not present 
In the fields of my city grain is not present its farmer is not present 
In my field like a field that the pickax has struck to destroy it and render it unusable only the star of the field plant grows 
In the irrigated orchards that heap up syrup and wine the thornbush of the mountain grows grows 
In the steppe whose joy was surpassingfilled it it was emitting a baking scent like an oven  My possessions are taken away flying like a flock of crows taking flight I must cry My possessions 
My possessions coming from the lowland are brought back to the lowland I must cry My possessions 
My possessions coming from the highland are brought back to the highland I must cry My possessions 
The storm scatters me away from my precious metal and lapis I must cry My possessions  My treasure is annihilated I must cry My possessions 
People who know nothing of precious metal fill the hand with my precious metal and consume it 
People who know nothing of lapis load their necks with my lapis 
It is the month of GurInanna the 14th day 
Father Nanna your iib priest did not perfect the holy ita prayer for you 
Your lumah priest did not wear the aggada garment 
Your true en priestess chosen in the heart for her beauty the one of the Ekinugal temple 
Did not enter as she rejoices into the gipar structure coming from the shrine  The aua musicians are not sweetening the festival in your courtyard hosting the festival 
Neither the em and ala drums those which make the heart rejoice nor the tigi instrument was played for you 
The blackheaded who no longer bathed for your festival  If like a thread  their life was cut their features were changed 
Your songs have become weeping how long   Your tigi songs have become lamentation how long  
If your bull does not stand in its stall how long   If your sheep does not stand in its fold how long  
An evildoer has seized your fisherman who brings fish  Your fowler who bring birds hurriedly goes away 
In your canal formerly made suitable for a barge rushes grew in its bed 
On your roads formerly made suitable for a chariot thorn bushes grew in its midst 
Your city and you temple weep for you bitterly like their mother 
Urim like a child lost in the street seeks your place 
The brickwork of your true temple like a human says So be itin resignation 
My lady you have left the temple you have left the city  How long will you stand apart from your city like an enemy 
Mother Ningal how long will your temple align with you at its chest like a hostile place 
If you are one who is concerned about her land why do you reject it 
Like an ox towardson behalf of your cattlepen like a sheep towardson behalf of your sheepfold  Like a younger child towardson behalf of your mothers chamber my lady towardson behalf of your temple 
May An the king of the gods speak your It is enough  Enlil the king of the lands shall decree your fate 
He shall restore your city to its place exercise its queenship  He shall restore Urim to its place exercise its queenship 
It is the eighth kirugu  Your me that were changed to your detriment may he restore your me to their place 
It is its gegigal response  Oh the storm the storm has been cast down in the land together 
Great storm of An continually shouting storm 
That bitter day storm passed in the land  The storm destroying the city the storm destroying the temple 
The storm destroying the cattlepen and flattening the sheepfold 
That one that paralyzed the pure rites  The one who defiled the rites those of Aratta ie important 
That storm that cut off a good thing in the land  That storm that bound the arms of the blackheaded people 
It is the 9th kirugu  That storm that storm that has no shame in its face 
That storm that knows no mother that storm that knows no father 
That storm that knows no spouse that storm that knows no child 
That storm that knows no sister that storm that knows no brother 
That storm that knows no neighbor that storm that knows no girlfriend 
The storm that cast the spouse the storm that cast down the child 
That storm the storm of having made the land forgotten 
The hating day storm that was made to pass by Enlil 
Father Nanna that storm must never again be placed upon your city 
That storm like a rain storm raining from above must not turn towards that place 
It has cast a fearful aura upon the creatures of the universe and the blackheaded  When the storm is bound by the hands it must be destroyed 
Like a gate at nighttime the door must be tied shut to keep it out  Its balanced account in the temple of Enlil must be torn away from its peg 
It is the 1th kirugu  In distant time and future time today and in the futurethe end of days 
In distant time after the land was founded again like before  Nanna the humble man who took to your path ie followed youseized your feet 
Has performed the lament of the silent house for you the oneas one performing before you 
The black headed that had fallen away from the path they shall stroke the nose in submission for you   shall initiate the wailing of the city that had been rendered into ruin heaps for you 
Nanna  shall make your city that has been restored to its place resplendent again for you 
Like a pure heavenly star which must never be forgotten it will pass before you  The personal god has brought a kadra greeting gift for you 
The one of the siskur prayerrites makes an arazu prayer for you  Nanna you are the one filled with mercy of the land 
Lord Dilimbabbar after your heart has spoken  Nanna after you has released the sin of that man 
The one who makes an arazu prayer shall pacify your heart for him  After you have looked faithfully towards the one of the siskur prayerrites who has served 
Nanna your true look is full of mercy 
May the man who the storm unleashed evil against shine towards you  As one who is in the midst of the land may he bow towards you 
Nanna may you be praised in your restored city 
It is the 11th kirugu 
It is the 2nd kirugu  It is the gegigal response 
It is the gegigal response  An stretched out his hand and tore out  he terrified the land 
Enlil trembled greatly and shouted  The flood digging at the earth with a hoe raised its voice 
Its vanguard is a DUR1 GAG axedrainpipe its rear is darkness  Its light of its eye which flashes it is to look far away like the Anzud bird 
Its mouth is furious it is to exude with flame in the mountainland  Its tongue is flame raining glowing coals it is to split the land 
Its wings are that of the supreme Anzud bird with opened knees ie outstretched talons which nothing can escape 
Its ribcage was something that was to open in its hinges disintegrating like the melting sun 
On its hips are the slingstones the destroyers of cities which are attached to the binding 
Its thighs are twistingdripping daggers covered with blood it is to draw out gore 
Its muscles are umme saws that are to cut its feet are that of the hurin bird  It has terrified the Tigris and Euphrates it has screamed at the mountainnetherworld 
Because of its shout the mountain range is  the people are spread out as sheaves 
Sumer and Akkad have been made to tremble they will drown like a harvest 
The unwitting ones rejoiced they  

The city of the princely me floating in the flood water was setsailed upstream in the water  
One could set foot in its broad marsh as if it was dry land in its midst the thornbush of the mountain  
The boat of joy the ibex of the Abzu abandoned the water its reed cabin was brought near to the riverbank 
Sirsir and Abbau who are indeed the men of the barge at the prow of the boat they  both eyes 
Within the temple the enemy destroyed its me were thrown into confusion 
The enemy destroyed the giguna structure and the oval of the temple they irreparably changed its plans  
The Eunir temple the shrine that had raised its head like heaven its protective aegis  
The greatest gate the face of a lion gate where fate is determined the enemy tore out the doors 
Kahegal and Igiegal the doorkeepers of the temple  
At the Emah temple of Enki a place suitable for awe the wisdom of the land  
 who made the cultic place known  of the Anuna  
The one who shouted  in the land   exuberant  
 exuberant  
In Eridu   The marshland of the city fire  
In Eridu a goring ox   Although  was not a marsh boar  
In Eridu like a bull   The lady of the city says my city the city  alas  
It is the 3rd kirigu  Father Enki alas your temple alas your city alas your people In the land  
It is the gegigal response 
Teeming  fruit    covered like a garment 
 threw  into confusion there    its frontfaceeye  
 shook  the god of the land  
 shook  
 dark  the people   Enlil  an evil   its booty 
The citizens of Nippur like caught birds he  in his hand 
like dogs he put yokes on the necks of its people 
Enlil changed the settlement of Nippur  
Towards the Ekur he cut  no one entered towards him 
The lamma and aladedu spirits of the temple went out the ukuku bird the bird of despair made its nest there 
Enlil made the enemy look at his city Nippur his city that was no more 
And therefore he terrified the Ekur the dwelling the temple  
He frowned at the holy shrine the inner sanctum of his divinity behind him  
Enlil was destroying   
The city threw itself over the lands  
The door of the Ekur temple  covered its bolt   His property  
Enlil  the city  Enlil  
The gate where grain is not cutdiverted gate of the Ekur complex   Enlil  
His fertile field   The well and orchard that did not bear fruit Enlil  
He  the rain of heaven  The wild and domestic herds of Sumuqan  in a state of noneating they came to an end 
The intake of the Tigris and Euphrates was blocked the carp flood  its spring 
All the smaller waterways filled up with silt the banks   A watch was set on the broad sea in the marsh the fish  
The libir demonpoliceman  on the paths and roads  The highway traveler did not relax  
Enlil stood open the door at the gate of his city open in the wind at the gate of the lands  the door 
He brought the impure person into Nippur no one could  clear water 
You abandoned  its people  
 lay fasting   sat down and wept  
 on account of his  a pained cry   It is the nth kirugu

Be silent idiot how long until you are not haughty  Like a comb with only 4 teeth you do not bring the workforce together 
Your colleagues say he is a rogue but you are wise  He should not have spoken insulting words to you 
After you submit the matter set it before me  The one reckoned as the insulter 
So that his guilt is imposed upon him  How could you put a man like that in the place of learning 
It is good that you pl quarrel  It has been 2 times it has been 5 words I said to them calm down 
Why do you today and daily before that cast downpick up quarreling  Now what corporeal punishment is to be smitten should you accept

After they ordered the obliteration of my city  After they ordered the obliteration of Urim  After they decreed the killing of its people 

If  has not known the time I will die  Plain you would know the appropriate word and speakit like my mother would  So that  would weep for me like my little sister 
He laid down in that distant time he laid down in that distant time the shepherd laid down in that distant time 
When the shepherd laid down in that distant time he laid down in order to dreamin a dream  He arose it was a dream he shivered it was deep sleep 
He sought his face with his hands his silent stupor was causing a feeling of emptiness  Bring her bring her bring my sister 
Bring my Getinanna bring my sister  Bring my singer who knows endu songs bring my sister 
Bring my singer who knows endu songs bring my sister 
So that I may reveal the dream for her  In the dream my sister in the dream these are the contents of my dream  Rushes were rising for me rushes were growing for me 
A reed planted alone was shaking its head at me  Several reeds planted together split apart for me 
In the forest a tree has raised itself for me as high as heaven   poured water among my pure coals 
 openedremovedbroke to bits the chamber of my pure churn  My holy anzam vessel which had been hanging from a peg was torn off from the peg 
 made my stick of manu wood disappear  A ninninata bird of prey took a lamb at the sheep hut 
A falcon took a small bird at the reed fence  Churns were sitting idle one no longer poured milk from them 
The anzam containers were sitting idle Dumuzid was no longer dwelling therealive the sheepfold had been made into an empty wind 
My goat buck was swishing its lapis beard in the dirt  My ram was scratching the ground with their thickcurved horns

Hero standing on his ribs for battle  Lord whose powerfulright hand opens on behalf ofis set upon the mitum weapon  Who gleans the necks of the disobedient like barley  Ninurta king son whose father rejoices at his might 
Hero covering the mountain like a southern storm  Ninurta your crownwhose true crown is a rainbow your face thrashing lightning 
Possessing the strengthshoulder of a lion sticking out its tongue in the manner of a snake hissing in the manner of   Ninurta king who Enlil made superior to himself  Hero ugal net that overwhelms the enemy 
Ninurta your aura and shade are stretched over the land  Bringing anger to the rebel land gathering up the assembly  Ninurta the king the son who profoundly humbles himself to his father 
When he occupied the throne upon the supreme dais when he bore a great aura  When he initiated a festival when he rejoiced when he sat broadly 
When he was rivaling An and Enlil when he was to be sweetened by liquor  When Bau was to plead with arazu prayers of the king 
When Ninurta the son of Enlil was to determine fate  At that time the weapon of the lord looked at the mountain 
arur above on the one hand was speaking to the king  Lord of heavenly station who occupies the dais in the assemblythrone room 
Ninurta you utterance never wavers your decreed fate is put faithfully in effect 
My king heaven mated with the verdant earth 
Ninurta it gave birth to a warrior that knows no fear the Asag 
One that did not sit as a child with a wetnurse who suckled milk by itselfsuckled fear as milk 
My king one that did not know the rearing of a father the slaughterer of the mountain 
A youth that has left his scentsweat ie has no odor possessor of a face that has no shame 
Ninurta one that lifts itself and rejoices with its form  My hero who is a bull I shall lean upon 
My king it is one who turns to his city acting as a mother  It procreated in the mountains it spread out its seed 
Together they shall name it the plants as their king  In their midst like a great bull it raises its horn 
The uu sagkal diorite usium and kagina stones  Hero along with alabaster as warriors they plundered the city  It grew the tooth of the kuu creature in the mountain  were shakingdragging the trees there 
Its power makes the city and its gods bow to the ground  My king this one has cast down a dais its slacked arm does not relent 
Ninurta lord it has decided its cases just like you  Against the Asag against its aura who penetrates with their hand  Who could set out against its great temples 
My lord the mountain has conveyed its nindaba offerings to that place  Hero it has inquired about you because of your father your lineage 
Son of Enlil lord it has sought after your location because of your supreme power  My king it has advised you because of your might  It said Ninurta you shoulder singular warrior never idle 
It has ordered you because ofas   Hero the intent to carry away your kingship is present in these queries 
Apply  for the hunger ration of the land may your yield fill the hand ofbe given to your city  Apply  for the hunger ration of the land may your yield fill the hand ofbe given to your city 
You shall be derided you shall be the champion only of the servant girls  Hurry run shall be said to you you shall be called this name 
Now it is the determined fate of Ninurta  So that the land performs a painful task thus it is so 
Subtotal   8 lines  Ninurta the son of Enlil was decreeing a fate 
Diorite your battle is changed at its rear  Like thick smoke you are fixed there for me  You did not raise an arm against me you did not seek me out 
Ninurta son of Enlil hero who is like you  My king the hero you established for your regular offerings 
The one who has made an ancient thing manifest in your temple  The one who made  rise from the dust for you in your shrine  He shall make everything in your festival the greatest 
He shall perfect your holy rites for you  During the years of my life  is suitable for speech and therefore I shall be praised in the land 
For the lord may he appease the heart of An  For the strength of Enlil that of Ninurta 
May the young woman mother Bau come out as sunlight for him  For the lord  on the boat loaded with nesag offerings 
The boat floating downstream by itself gathered together   The vessel set out from the noble harbor sailed with cultic purity 
On behalf of the wellbeing of the hero that smites with the weapon   The Anuna gods met him  
They drew their noses to the ground and  their hands to their chests  For the lord they uttered ud prayers with supplication 
Therefore you  the rebel land from the highland  The mountain that you gave away shall not be restored to its place 
Its cities shall be broken up into ruin heaps  Its great rulers do not breathe anymore because of you 
The udugita mace of Anheaven a good reign that will not change  A life of distant days the aidtrust of Enlil 
The neck stock the strength of Anheaven these shall be your gift  Because the hero killed the Asag 
Because the lord made its pile of stones  Because he said May the stone be rivaled  Because the uum serpent screamed and he  
Because the hero established the path of the water on the short upper side of the field 
Because he repaidavenged the fertile field  Because he made the plow ofand abundance manifest 
Because he set in place the standing furrow  Because Ninurta the son of Enlil piled up large and small grain heaps 
The lord  the strength of heroism   Foremost one  
The great pirig creature   The small pirig creature

Was attacking in a pack like wolves  For Enki the water of the stern 
Was slaughtering like a lion  At that time there was a single tree a halub tree 
The one that was planted on the bank of the Euphrates at the junction with the Iturungal canal  The one that was to drink water from the Euphrates at the junction with the Iturungal canal  The power of the southern wind tore it out at its roots it ripped it out at its branches 
The Euphrates at the junction with the Iturungal canal struck it with floodwater  I the woman fearing the command of An was coming by 
Fearing the command of Enlil I was coming by  The Iturungal canal struck it with floodwater  I the woman who was fearing the command of An was coming by 
Fearing the command of Enlil I was coming by  I grasped the tree in my hand and brought it to Uruk 
I was bringing it towards the flowering orchard of Inanna  I the woman did not plant the tree as it was in my hand  It was by means of my foot that I planted it 
I the woman did not plant the tree as it was in my hand  It was by means of my foot that I watered it  I said When am I to sit on its flowering throne 
The Euphrates struck it with floodwater  I the woman fearing the command of An was coming by  Fearing the command of Enlil I was coming by

I said When am I to sit on its flowering throne  I said When am I to lay on its flowering bed  The wood thickened but its bark could not be split 
At its base a snake that was immune to incantations made a nest  In its branches the Anzu bird placed its chick 
The demon maiden of the empty wind made a house in its middle  For Enki the water of the stern 
Was slaughtering like a lion  At that time there was a single tree a halub tree a boxwood tree  It was the one that was planted on the bank of the EuphratesIturungal canal

A laughing rejoicing young woman  I am Inanna who is now weeping

The keel of the little boat of Enki 
When  gifted that of the netherworld on behalf of ErekigalWhen that of the netherworld was gifted on behalf of Erekigal 
When he rode when he rode  When the father rode towards the netherworld  Rising at dawn 
 riding his ball  They were lamenting with the phrase Oh my neck oh my hips 
Away fromby means of the accusation of the widows 
For the mother of Ninazu Erekigal the recumbent one  Her holy knees are not covered with a garment  Her holy chest is not spread over with linen 
Enkidu did not accept the words of his master  He wore his cleanest garment 
And therefore they marked him as a stranger  He anointed himself with sweet oil from a stone vessel 
They flocked around him because of its scent  He struck the netherworld with a bowthrowstick  Those who had been struck by a bowthrowstick flocked around him 
He put a willow stick in his hand  Ghosts gathered up around him  His put sandals on his feet 
He spoke aloud in the netherworld  He kissed his beloved spouse 
He pelted the spouse he detested  Did you see the man who had one child How has he fared  A nail is fixed in his wall he makes a bitter cry 
Did you see the man who had two children How has he fared  Upon two bricks he is sitting he is eating food 
Did you see the man who had three children How has he fared 
He is to drink water from the waterskin of the saddle peg  Did you see the man who had 4 children How has he fared 
Like a man who yokes 4 donkeys his heart is pleasedrejoicing 
Did you see the man who had five children How has he fared 
Like a good scribe he has opened his armspower he enters the palace straightaway 
Did you see the man who had six children How has he fared 
Like one who yokes a plow his heart is pleasedrejoicing  Did you see the man who had seven children How has he fared 
 did not seize him the netherworld seized him   did not seize him the netherworld seized him 
The site of manhood did not fell him in battle the netherworld seized him  The udug demon begotten by Nergal did not seize him the netherworld seized him 
Father Enlil did not stand with him in this matter so he set out alone to Eridu   cast my ball into the netherworld 
 cast my mallet into the netherworld  Father Enki stood with him in the matter 
He was speaking to the hero and youth Utu  Now after you open a hole in the netherworld 
Bring up his servant from the netherworld  The hero youth Utu the son given birth to be Ningal 
He opened up a hole in the netherworld  By means of his breeze Utus son a dream god he brought it an aspect of Enkidu out from the netherworld 
He repeatedly hugged him and kissed him 
He was exhausting him with inquiries  Would that you will speak to me would that you will speak to me 
You are someone that has seen the orders of the netherworld  Would that you will speak to me would that you will speak to me 
You should not kiss your beloved son  You should not pelt your hated son 
The complaint of the netherworld would seize you  For the recumbent one for the recumbent one  For hero Ninazu the recumbent one 
Where will  be brought to how will  succeed   Where will  be brought to how will  succeed  
Because of my uttered words  does not  weeping  If I tell you about the regulations of the netherworld 
You must sit and weep and I shall sit and weep  The penis that  has planted by which you have pleased your libido 
Like the wood of a dilapidated house it is infested by parasites  Having said where is the vagina I shall go to her 
That vagina is filled with dust like a crevice  The lord said alas and sat in the dust 
It was made pleasing there for lord Gilgamesh  In his city as a single man he sounded the horn  In his city as a single man he sounded the horn 
As two companions he and Enkidu they shouted together  As two companions he and Enkidu they shouted together  The one who has a household to his household the one who has lives with a mother to his mother 
The one who has a household to his household the one who has lives with a mother to his mother  May single males acting like me fifty of them act on behalf of my power  May single males acting like me fifty of them act on behalf of my power

Like a great meadow in which the carp flood expands  The flooded field did not produce fish after the water drained 
The irrigated orchard did not produce syrup and wine  The seven balag drums were set on the ground like the standing horizon 
The ub and em drums resounding like Ikur  played in its midst  He actively diminished your giguna and therefore should be madebound like Nibru 
In your city may headscorpses  in its wellsponds 
It was the frown of Enlil  After it killed Kish like the bull of heaven 
After it slew the temple of Uruk in the dust like a great bull 
Where at that time to Sargon the king of Agade  From the lowland to the highland  After Enlil gave the enship and kingship to him 
At that time the sanctuary Agade holy Inanna   May distress fall upon your palace which was built for rejoicing

The one that is saying  my city  Kazallu the city that teemed by itself was confused 
Numuda took a different path away from his city his beloved dwelling  His wife Namrat the beautiful woman was weeping bitterly 
Emptiness was in the river  could not irrigate  Like a river cursed by Enki its intake was blocked 
 did not have grain in the field the people did not eat  The watered orchards were baked like an oven the plain was dispersed 
Its throne was covered over from the front she could only sit in the dust instead  They seized the great cows atby their  horns  cut their horns off   smote goring bulls with the weapon like they were grazing sheep 
The date palm of like strong copper the arm of heroism   tore it out like a rush it was cut like a rush it was turned sideways in its roots 
Its top was lodged in the ground it did not have a person to raise it   trimmed its midribs and set its top on fire 
 its spadix with ripe dates  the well  The gizi reeds that grew in the holy  and the trees were bowed to the ground 
The great tribute that  deposited there was carried away into the mountain  In the temple its gebur ormanment fell its parapet was destroyed 
Its  embracing on its right and left  Like smitten heroes they were covered from the front 
Its great stormdemon with an open mouth and the face of an awebearing pirig creature  The enemy territory brought away the one felled with a saman rope like a caught wild bull 
The scent of the dwelling of holy Nanna which was like a juniper forest was brought to an end 
And the awe of the temple which had been goodthe awe was now destroyed  The one that filled the lands like sunlight was rebuilt like the evening in heaven instead 
People who did not know butter were churning its butter  People who did not know cream were  its cream 
In the cattle pen the churning churn was not bellowing nobly  The heavy coals that had been lit their smoke ceased   the great dining hall of Nanna

Holy An the great words of his mouth are not to be abrogated 
The great gods bow down to him like a curved staff in approval of and in prayer to him  
What you command is just Like what a prince or lord has uttered what you have commanded is obeyed 
An your lofty command takes precedence who would say No to you 
Father of the gods your word the foundation of heaven and earth no god fails to heed it  
Lord you are the leader who takes only his own counsel what should be our counsel 
Grant your strength to the maiden Itar whom you have loved   
Your reliable approval weighty as heaven make known to her in our assembly  
Give to the mistress whom you have loved your combined divine powers   
Let Kiar truly be the spouse equal with you may she rise to the equivalent authority of your name  
Moreover in addition let her carry out herself the decrees of Enlil and Enki    
When she alone has taken hold of the noserope of heaven and earth she shall be our strength 
For An the pleasant conversation produced happiness
He in his goodness of heart treated holy Inanna well   
The commands of my Anuship are the complex fundament of heaven which cannot be equaled  
My fixed boundaries whose exteriors are fearsome and know no approaching 
I am AnarAnu the kings helper do take hold of their band   
Do take for yourself the entire extent of their territory exercise alone the ruling of them
Come rise up to my dais of kingship and dwell in the heights
Corresponding to my called name may Exalted KiarAntu be your called name 
My faithful vizier whose lips are prized who is aware of my secrets 
Ninubur my fitting vizier shall exercise the status of father with you 
May he standing before you constantly present auspicious words from every god and goddess 
At the eternal foundation of heaven and earth and by the enduring designs of the gods  
when in the beginning Anu Enlil and Ea allotted the shares 
for the two gods the watchmen of heaven and netherworld the ones who open the door of Anu
for moongod and sungod the night and day were made in equal parts 
and from the bottom of heaven to the top of heaven they assign them their tasks 
to keep all the stars of heaven on course as in a furrow 
to make the leading gods keep to their paths like oxen 
Up into that place Inanna rise to the rulership of them all 
Lady you be the brightest of them so may they call you Itar of the Stars  
May your high position relative to them alternate between the two sides east and west triumphantly
May your splendor be as abundant as that of the moon and sun in their watches 
May the flaring glow of your torch shine high in the sky  
May the people marvel at you as one for whom among the gods there is none to check up on her
After the lord had bestowed these great powers upon the daughter of Sn 
he did not keep her away from the shrine Eanna her sacred chamber
After king Anu had bestowed the great powers upon her 
they presented to her the shrine Eanna her sacred chamber 
He covered her figure with the ceremonial garment of Anuhood the brilliant splendor of Sn
He made her appear like the day with superb ornaments the ornaments of divinity 
He enhanced her arm with the scepter of kingship the fierce wood staff the unsparing weapon   
A glorious crown which is like that on the head of Nanna he set firmly upon her head  
O Hierodule my important decisions divine powers which could not be asked for by anyone else I have assigned to you 
Like me may Enlil king of all the lands treat you well  
Because of this Lord Nunamnira became happy his liver surged with joy

May the arrowhead that pierces lungs and heart go back and forth like a shuttle 
Inanna after you have made fighting and battle flip about like a skiprope 
O lady of battle make them clash together like a ball and driving stick 
Goddess of contention make battle be pursued like puppetsdolls being manipulated 
Lady at the place of clashing of weapons strike with chaos like the banging down of astragals 
Inanna when like an overwhelming storm you are consolidating the contingents of battle 
when you demonstrate your great ability with the divine mace the doubleheaded ax the big sword and arrows  
when you put on the fierce armor let the deluge rage 
When you make ready your bowthrowstick and shield of battle may the storms whirl about for you 
May your raging divine weapon strike the evil person with lightning like the plague god Erra 
Lady at the place of clashing of weapons and planting of standards no one can get away from the opening of your arms 
My daughter wherever it is pleasing to you to extend upwards to extend downwards to pull taut or to loosen 
Having no limits at the place where destinies are decided your pronouncements are indeed as great as my pronouncements 
At festivals offerings banquets prostration making obeisance and invoking the name of the god 
a human being whose god has gotten very angry with him whose goddess has become souredjealous towards him 
as long as he does not seek out the place of reconciliation with your divinity no god will be agreeable to his petition 
At my city the mountain of Sumer and Akkad the shade of the world quarters 
at Duranki the bond of heaven and earth the foundation of all constructed settlements  
at my royal dais reposing like a horned bull or elephant at the obeisances of the gods 
at my sanctuary Nippur the shrine of Enlilship the mainstaygreat wall of the nation 
the sanctuary the relaxing dwelling place which is called by my name 
may your ladyship also be manifested in that place may your name be called Queen of Nippur 
The good protective spirit my eloquent god who is standing in front of me 
the craftsman of the centerpoint of the Ekur temple discoverer of advice and planning the finest oil 
let be your guardian be he against whom your wrath was great and whom your divine fury has overcome 
May wise Ninimmaimma cool your heart with pleasant conversations 
Lady I have established for you my weighty commands divine powers that should not be demanded by anyone 
as I have done may Ea king of the Apsu treat you well 
Because of this the prince Nudimmud became happy his liver rose with joy

and for his life his happiness and the hearing of his prayers 
in Ezida the house beloved of Nab placed 
It was time to decide destinies in heaven and on earth  Lagash had raised the head towards heaven in large me 
Enlil looked righteously upon lord Ningirsu 
Did the nig2ul not emerge in our city  The heart did it not return to its banks 
The heart of Enlil did it not return to its banks  The heart did it not return to its banks 
The flood did it not twinkle Frightening all  The heart of Enlil it is the river Tigris did it not bring sweet water 
To the house its king spoke  I will make the me of Eninnu emerge in heaven and on earth 
The governor is wise he shall pay attention 
He shall enlarge big things  He shall straighten the horns of perfect oxen perfect goats 
The brick of deciding destinies lifted the head towards him  to build the shiny house it raised its neck towards him 
It was then in a dark goat that towards his king  on the lord Ningirsu Gudea looked 
Build his house he ordered him  On Eninnu whose me is very large 
he Ningirsu directed his Gudeas eye there  Gudea his heart is distant  counseled about the message 
Let me let me tell it to her let me let me tell it to her  may she stand by me in this case 
I am the shepherd princeliness was given to me  Of what my dark goat has revealed to me 
its heart I did not know  Let me bring my dream to her to my mother  My dreaminterpreter knowing ku3 on her own 
Nane my divine sister from Siraran  may she make its meaning visible for me 
Did he not set foot on his barge  Towards Nina her city on Ininadua he directed the barge 
he is breaking the waves of Ideula  After reaching Bagarahouse hanging over the river 
he sacrificed bread he poured out cold water 
he went to the king of Bagara and prayed to him  Hero charging lion having no rival 
Ningirsu boisterous in the Aps  being noble in Nippur 
Hero you spoke to me let me do it right for you  Ningirsu let me build your house for you 
let me make the me perfect for you  Your sister child born to Eridu 
hero in her own right ladydreaminterpreter of the gods  Nane my divine sister from Siraran 
may she place the path for me  His Gudeas prayer was being heard 
From Gudea his offering and his prayer his king  the lord Ningirsu received from him 
In the House of Bagara he celebrated the weekfestival  The governor set up his bed in the house of Gatumdu 
He sacrificed bread he poured out cold water 
He went to ShinyGatumdu  and then he is saying an offering to her  My lady child born by shiny An 
princely in her own right god with the raised head  living in the land 
knowing nig2du7 in her city  You are the lady the mother founder of Lagash 
With your looking at the people it is a bountiful wind  With your looking at the righteous hero the man for him life is prolonged 
I am a nomotherhaver you are my mother  I am a nofatherhaver you are my father 
You have placed my semen in the inside you bore me in the cella 
Gatumdu your shiny name is sweet  I will lay me down here this night 
you are my big dagger following my side  You are a reed planted in the big water 
you have placed life in me  You are a broad parasol under your shade  let me cool myself there 
With the index finger of your right hand  stroke me with it my lady Gatumdu 
I will go to the city may my sign be good  To Nina mountain raising out of the sea 
may your good Utukku go in front of me  may your good Lamma follow me on my path 
Let me let me tell it to her  Let me let me tell it to her  May she stand by me in this case 
Let me bring my dream to my mother  my dreaminterpreter knowing ku3 by herself 
Nane my divine lady from Siraran  may she make its meaning visible for me 
His cry was heard  His lady the offering and the prayer 
ShinyGatumdu received from Gudea  Did he not place the foot on the barge 
To her city Nina he moored at the port of Nina 
In the courtyard of the deity of Siraran the governor raised the head to heaven 
he sacrificed bread he poured out cold water 
He went to Nane he prayed to her  Nane large lady lady of precious precious me 
Lady like Enlil deciding destinies  My Nane your word is righteous 
it goes to the top  You are the dream interpreter of the gods  You are the lady of all the lands Mother my words in the day in the dream 
Inside the dream there was one man his greatness was like heaven 
his greatness was like the earth  He according to his head he was a god  according to his arm he was the Anzu 
according to his lower body he was the flood  Lions lay by his right and left 
He spoke to me about the building of his house  His heart I did not understand  A light went up on the horizon for me 
There was one woman Who was it who was it not 
going up to the top she made a haystack on the earth  She held a stylus of purified silver in the hand 
She had the tablet of the stars on her lap  She counseled it 
Secondly it was a hero  he bent the arm he held a lapis writing board in the hand 
he drew the plan of the house  In front of me stood a shiny basket 
a shiny mold was made ready  the brick of deciding destinies was placed in the mold for me 
In a just poplar standing in front of me  a tibubird passed the time tweeting 
A donkey stallion on the right side of my king scratched the earth for me 
His mother Nane answered the governor  My shepherd let me me interpret your dream for you 
The man who was great like the heaven who was great like the earth  who according to his head he was a god according to his arm 
he was the Anzu according to his lower body the flood  at whose right and left lions were lying 
it is surely my brother Ningirsu  Build his shrine the Eninnu He ordered you 
The light that went up for you on the horizon  it is your god Ningezida who like the light went up for you on the horizon 
The virgin going up to the top making a haystack on the earth 
holding a stylus of purified silver in her hand  placing the tablet of the stars on the lap 
counseled it  That is surely Nisaba my sister  About the shiny star of the building of the house 
she poured out her voice for you  The second one it was a hero with bent arm 
holding in the hand a lapis drawing board  it is Nindubba placing the house on the plan of the house 
The shiny basket standing in front of you the prepared shiny mold

When Enlil the king of the gods the great lord of all the lands
towards Utu his gracious eyes did direct and of Sippar
his ancient city and cult site its wall to build the Ebabbar temple
to restore of his ziggurrat and lofty high terrace its top to raise as high as the sky
and Utu and his consort erda into their sacred residence to introduce amidst very happy rejoicing
with his word which cannot be altered he spoke to him  At that time
for the hero youthful Utu a great destiny that by Enlil
regarding Sippar and the Ebabbar temple had been decreed happily
was set in place for him To me Samsuiluna the king created by him
he spoke happily and he issued to me the order for it At that time
all of Sumer and Akkad whose people had become hostile to me
within one year eight times I struck them with weapons
The various cities of my enemies I turned into mounds and ruins
The enemies and evildoers I tore out from the country their foundations
and the whole land I made dwell under my command From the time long ago
when the brickwork of the Ebabbar temple had been constructed among the kings who had gone before
no king had been favored by Utu and so the wall of Sippar
he had not built But I Samsuiluna one loved by Utu
and erda the mighty king king of Babylon
king of the four world quarters the king whose utterances with Utu
and erda have found favor at the commands of Utu and Marduk
through an army levy of my land in the middle of that year
its bricks for it I had formed and the wall of Sippar I raised up like a great mountain
I renovated the Ebabbar their exalted high terrace of the ziggurrat
I raised up its top like the sky and Utu Ikur and erda
into their sacred residence amidst very happy rejoicing I introduced
To the Ebabbar I returned its favorable guardian genius That which to the welfare of Utu Ikur
and erda was pleasing I did and that commanded by Utu
and Marduk I put in place Of that wall Utu
to Samsuiluna Authority Might and Life
Has Presented as a Gift is its name Because of this Utu
who his throne has therefore supported life an enduring happy heart
kingship which has no rival a scepter of justice that keeps the country secure
a mighty weapon which pounds the foreigners and rule over the four world quarters
to exercise forever as his gifts he gave to him

Lady of the many me emergent sunlight 
True woman bearing an aura beloved of An and Ura 
nugig midwife of heaven she of the greatest pectoral  Who loves the true crown who is suitable for the enship 
Who actively regulates the seven me  My lady you are the caretaker of all the great me 
You have carried the me you have bound the me to your hand  You have gathered up the me you have clasped the me to your chest 
Like an uumgal monster you have poisoned the mountain  When you roar at the earth like Ikur Ezina the grain goddess has not withstood you 
Flood coming down from the mountain  Foremost of the universe you are its Inanna 
Raining burning fire on the homeland  The one who An gave the cosmic powers lady who rode a dog 
Issuing commandsconversing by means of holy An  Who has known the great rites that which is yours 
Destroyer of the mountain you have given strength to the storm  Beloved of Enlil who has imposed fear in the homeland 
You standserve because of the command of An  My lady you are the one who makes  bow in the mountain towardson behalf of your shout 
Along with the aura radiance and the southern stormwind the furious stupor of the people  you have brought for yourself to the fore 
You have taken the most furious of the cosmic powers for yourself   has opened the threshold of mourning for you 
 goes on the street of the temple of greatest lamentation ie the netherworld for you  My lady inwith your own power flints consume  The one who is to thrash like a thrashing storm 
You shout together with the shouting storm  You scream along with Ikur  You are to become exhausted together with the destructive winds 
But your anger does not cool eldest child of Nanna  Lady who surpasses the mountainlandnetherworld who has taken from your place 
The mountain range extends with you in your place it is the taboo of reserved for Ezina the grain goddess  Fire was imposed on its gate 
Blood is poured into its rivers for you and therefore the people cannot drink  Its army plunders itself for you 
The formations split themselves apart for you  Its ablebodied young man chases himself away for you 
A northern stormrage has filled its cities and playgrounds  Its perfect young men were hurried away as corpses 
The city that has not compelled its people to say the landmountain is for you  Nor has it compelled its people to have said your father  
Despite your holy word being spoken to them may your feet will stumblechurn upon that place  May the city slip away from its wombmatrix ie be stillborn 
Its woman shall not say pleasant things with her husband  Nor advise him at night 
Nor reveal the purity of her heart  Aroused wild cow eldest child of Suen 
Lady who is superior to Anheaven who has deprived you 
One who validates the cosmic powers great queen of queens  One who emerged from the holy womb superior to her birth mother 
Wise discerning queen of the lands  And the teeming creatures and people alike I want to perform your holy song 
True deity greatly suitable for the cosmic powers your utterance is supreme 
Possessing a profound mind true woman possessing a purebright heart I want to speak to you about the true cosmic powers 
I shall enter into my holy cloister  I am the en priestess I am Enheduana  The masab basket was carried the asila was intoned 
 established funerary offeringsa good site as if I was not living there  I approached the sunlight the sunlight was burning 
I approached the shade but it was covered by lit along with a southern storm  My honey mouth was  
In the place of life giving forceencouragement what am I  The rebel land because of hatred of your Nannain the manner of one hated by your Nanna may An hand it over  May An tear apart its city 
May Enlil curse it  His mother shall not calm down its weeping childcitizen  Lady whose lament is under way 
May your boat of lamentation be abandoned in a strange place  I am to die because of my holy song 
But as for me my Nanna has not judged my case  He is to cause my destruction in a place of violence 
Dilimbabbar has not undertaken my case  If he did what is to me If he did not what is it to me 
After triumphing he Lugalane drove me out from the temple  Like a swallow he made me fly away from the window my life was consumed 
I am the one who he makes go in the brambles of the mountain  He removed the true crown of the en priestess from my head 
He gave a knife and dagger to me and said to me it is suitable for you  Most precious lady loved by An 
May your holy heart which is supreme be restored to its place for me  Beloved spouse of Amauumgalana Dumuzi 
You are the great queen of the horizon and zenith ie the whole of heaven  The Anuna have submitted to you 
Since birth you have been the younger sister of Utu  And thus you have been superior to the Anuna the great gods 
The Anuna kiss the ground with their lips for you  My case has not been finalized but the threat of a hostile decision that of his Lugalanes case prowls around in my face 
He Lugalane has not defiled the flowered bed  The uttered word of Ningal was not  to him 
I am the purebright en priestess of Nanna  The charcoal has been piled up the cleansing rites have been set in order  The holy tavern has been set up for you so that you heart is cooled to me 
After it the matter filled up and became too much my lady and queen as has been spoken to you  That which was said to you in the nighttime 
The lamentation priest should repeat as if at midday for you  Because of your captured spouse because of your captured child 
Your anger has been maximized your heart does not cool  You are the perfect lady the authoritative one of the assembly 
She accepted her siskur offeringritual on her Enheduanas behalf  And the holy heart of Inanna was restored to its place for her 
At that time it was good for her she radiated plentyhappiness she exuded joyful allure 
Nanna faithfully brought out awe  Because her mother Ningal prayed a ud prayer for her 
The gate of heavenAn was greeting her  Destroyer of the mountain allocated the cosmic powers by An 
My lady clad in allure  Inanna praise 
lady of the many me 
Urim has initiated lamentation to her detriment  Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
It is its gegigal response  At that time this time after the city was flattened  To the detriment of the lady her city is destroyed 
Her city is destroyed to her detriment her me are changed to her detriment  At that time this time after the city was created 
When they have spoken the order forordered my city to be destroyed  When they have spoken the order forordered Urim to be destroyed 
When they have ordered its people to be killed  At that time I will not be indifferent to my city 
I will not neglect my land  For An I shall pour the tears of my eyes 
I shall supplicate myself to Enlil  I shall say to him My city must not be destroyed 
I shall say to him Urim must not be destroyed  I shall say to him Its people must not be killed 
Despite this An did not rescind his word  Despite this the statement It is good so be it of Enlil was not soothing my heart 
Therefore when they have ordered my city to be destroyed  When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed 
When they have ordered its people to be killed  For a 2nd time after they convened an assembly a solemn place 
The Anuna rested on the organized ie finalized word  Therefore I shall extend my limbslap and tie up my hair 
For An I shall pour the tears of my eyes  I shall supplicate myself to Enlil 
I shall say to them My city must not be destroyed  I shall say to them Urim must not be destroyed 
I shall say to them Its people must not be killed  Despite this An did not rescind his word 
Despite this the statement It is good so be it of Enlil was not soothing my heart  Therefore when they have ordered my city to be destroyed 
When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed  When they have ordered its people to be killed 
I as one who gave my advice to my detriment   therefore shall also bind me with my city 
 therefore shall also bind Urim with me  An is never again to change this word 
That which issues from the mouth of Enlil is not to be changedEnlil will not change that which issues from his mouth  It is the 4th kirugu 
To the detriment of the lady her city is destroyed  Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
It is the gegigal response  Enlil spoke to the storm and the people wailed 
He deprived the land of days of abundance and the people wailed 
He deprived Sumer of good days and the people wailed 
He commanded the malevolent storm and the people wailed 
He gave them to the kiggal official of the storm his attendant stormwho stood within the storm 
He spoke to the storm annihilating the land and the people wailed 
He spoke to the great storm the one of An and the people wailed 
Enlil was making Gibil fire into his helper  He spoke to the great storm of An and the people wailed 
The great storm was shouting from above and the people wailed 
The storm annihilating the land roared upon the earth 
An evil wind overflowing like a great flood does not set down its powerwing 
In the city the weapon was murdering and devouring as if in a pack  At the base of heaven the storm gnawed and the people wailed 
The storm was burning with fire at its front 
And therefore the raging storm like a fireshade at its back fire like deep shade at its back  Noon which usually raises the rainy wind fog burned fire 
Midday which usually brings out bright sunlight brought darkness along with it  The shining sun did not come out in the land it dissipated like the evening 
The southern wind blockedcombined with to negate the joyful night which initiates the cooling of water 
Burning sherds combined with the soil and the people wailed  The storm blew a wind upon the blackheaded people and the people wailed 
Sumer was tripping as if in a snare and the people wailed  The people were erecting a wall of heads the storm devouring as if in a pack 
The bitter storm for which weeping was not decreed as its fate because of this the people wailed  The eradicatinggathering storm was sweeping the landmaking the land tremble 
The storm utterly destroyed the city like a flood  The storm that was finishing the land established silence in the city 
The storm burning like fire was enraged withcorporeally burned the people  The storm that is to cause everything to be forgotten stood among the malevolent ones 
The hateful storm ordered by Enlil the storm that  the land  It covered Ur like a garment spread over it like linen 
It is the 5th kirugu  The storm is a lion thrashing and the people wail 
It is its gegigal response  At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps

IbbiSn the god of his country the sovereign who how every sort of divine attribute

and king of the four world quarters when in Susa Adama
and the land of Awan he roared like a storm made them submit in a single day
and took their lords into captivity because Nanna had brought them back in his great arm
and had taken away their heavy gold and dark silver IbbiSn the prince with great power clad in fearsomeness
with wide intelligence  a golden seventeat jar
whose openings let out honeyed water whose golden drinking reed
is a channel running majestically a thing fit for the firstfruits offerings whose copper sickles
are strong multiple reed  a mountain range growing pure clean junipers
with breasts making things numerous for youthful Suen which are unceasing 
for his life he dedicated it to him A person who the order of an evil thing
shall issue regarding it and from the exalted platform of the divine dining hall and the festival place
of Nanna shall cause it to be held back may the great gods of heaven and earth
curse him
O Enlil with exalted utterances your judgments being high and wide 
issuing divine decisions whose word cannot be altered with  planning placed in his hands 
ImeDagan the strong young man with the muscles and body of a lion strong youth possessing fearsomeness 
who alone is exalted lord whose called good name is demonstrated in all lands 
under his sway he has made the living creatures numerous  and into whose hand were given the Black Headed People in their shelters where the people reside 
They prepared correctly for him the firstfruit offerings of the land  They are not merely left to him in his good palace 
At that time ImeDagan the youth the hero of the runners 
to Nippur being the city where the seed of the myriad people sprang up where the living were born 
the reverent runner who serves night and day without ceasing 
who daily brings everything needed made a great resolution 
When he rises up it is gigantic a flood bringing a wind in its fury 
With his arms swinging open over and over he flashes across distant miles 
like a fierce lion of the steppe going with strength and youthfulness 
opening wide his knees on the highway striding towards battle and combat 
like a horse  on the highway with its tail extended  like a buck when racing around inspiring fear  
whose his knees when set free are untiring  
the son who brings everything for Enlil  and also that which gladdens the heart of Ninlil 
the king cares unceasingly for the lapis lazuli shrine  At that time ImeDagan a copper statue which inspires fear as it races against the storm 
in the temple clad in fearsomeness upon his most precious dais  he set it up and colored it brilliantly 
The great prince of the whole heaven the lord whose utterance cannot be altered 
his shining brow and raised righteous eyes  may he let be upon him directed towards the faithful shepherd whom he has engendered 
But a king who orders a wicked thing  and erases this inscription and writes his own name upon it 
or because of this curse incites another person to do it  may Enlil my master and Ninli my mistress curse that person 
May Enki Ikur Ezinu and akan the lords of abundance 
after locking up abundance in heaven and earth  him evilly 
For Ninlil the exalted queen   most resplendant of of the Anuna gods 
 in heaven and earth  like  
their daises  their daises 
for kingship  he the one given the crown and scepter
for the great mother of the Anuna gods  the mistress of the Kiur 
the exalted shrine Ekurs  divine attributes to select 
the Nippur shrine Durankis  ritual lustrations to cleanse  to make the divine rites that had fallen away 
reappear magnificently and Nippur the bellwether of the nation
to restore to its previous state it was UrNinurta the one serving the Ekur
upon whom Enlil the king of all the lands out over the broad population
did lift his eye and did rightly choose for An Enlil and Ninlil
I removed evil and in the shining Ekur temple in the city  
I set them up for them Further copper figures whose bodily features   were made to resemble me 
with an offering kid were made in miniature  and set up for the delivering of my prayers 
as the main courtyard of the Gagiuas   ornament I fashioned for her Ninlil  and for my life
I dedicated them to her A person who an order of wickedness   shall issue against it
and my creation  shall efface by the exalted command of Enlil
 may his revealed name    be revoked from within the Ekur
May Ninurta the mighty warrior of Enlil  be the inseparable bailiff for this
for an eternity of days
To Enlil the king of all the lands  his master  Enlilbni
the mighty king king of Isin  and king of Sumer and Akkad 
beloved of Enlil  and Nininsina a thing 



For Ninlil  queen of the gods  king IddinDagn  
fashioned two big copper statues  but did not bring them to Nippur 
From the hands of IddinDagn  until king Enlilbni  it was 117 years 
that they stood in Isin  Ninlil with a happy heart 
desired it and gave command and so   Enlilbni the strong king 
king of Isin king of Sumer and Akkad  beloved of Enlil and Ninlil 
those two big copper statues  from within Isin  to Nippur he had brought 
In the great courtyard of the Gageua temple  before Ninlil his mistress he set them up 
Because of this Ninlil  the life of Enlilbni  from her place beside Enlil she lengthened its days 
A person who shall erase this inscription  may Enlil my master and Ninlil my mistress 
curse him
